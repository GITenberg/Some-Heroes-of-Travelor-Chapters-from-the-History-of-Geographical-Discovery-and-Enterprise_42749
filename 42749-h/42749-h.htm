<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present age is sometimes
described as an Age of Commonplace; but it has its romance if we
care to look for it.&nbsp; Assuredly, the adventures of its
travellers and explorers do not lose in importance or interest,
even when compared with those of their predecessors in days when
a great part of the world was still &ldquo;virgin
ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the following pages, this thesis is
illustrated by a summary of the narratives of certain
&ldquo;Heroes of Travel&rdquo; belonging to our own time; and I
believe it will be found that for &ldquo;stirring scenes&rdquo;
and &ldquo;hair-breadth escapes&rdquo; they vie with any which
the industrious Hakluyt, the quaint Purchas, or, coming down to a
later date, the multifarious Pinkerton has collected.&nbsp;
However, on this point the reader has an opportunity of
satisfying himself, as, by way of contrast, I have prefixed to
these Episodes of Recent Travel a succinct <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>account of
the enterprise of Messer Marco Polo, the Pioneer of
Medi&aelig;val Travellers.</p>
<p>There is no pleasanter mode of learning geography than by
studying the works of distinguished travellers; and therefore
this little book may claim to possess some slight educational
value, while primarily intended to supply the young with
attractive but not unwholesome reading.&nbsp; The narratives
which it contains have been selected with a view to variety or
interest.&nbsp; They range over Mexico, Western Australia,
Central Africa, and Central Asia.&nbsp; They include the
experiences of the hunter, the war correspondent, and the
geographical explorer; and, in recognition of the graceful
influence of women, of a lady traveller, who showed herself as
resolute and courageous as any of the so-called hardier
sex.&nbsp; And, finally, they have the merit, it is believed, of
not having appeared in previous compilations.</p>
<p>As a companion for the fireside corner, this little book will,
I hope, be welcome to all English-speaking lads and lasses, who
will learn from its pages how much may be accomplished by
patience, perseverance, and energy.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>SIR
MARCO POLO, THE VENETIAN,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND HIS TRAVELS IN ASIA.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> should be inclined to consider
Sir Marco Polo as one of the greatest travellers the world has
ever seen.&nbsp; It is true he was not a man of genius; that he
was not, like Columbus, inspired by a lofty enthusiasm; that he
displayed no commanding superiority of character.&nbsp; But when
we remember the vast compass of his journeys, and the
circumstances under which they were carried out; when we
remember, too, how close an observer he was, and how rigidly
accurate, and his plenitude of energy and perseverance&mdash;we
feel that he is, beyond all cavil or question, entitled to be
recognized as the king of medi&aelig;val travellers.&nbsp; Let us
take Colonel Yule&rsquo;s summary of his extraordinary
achievements:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the first Traveller to trace a route across the
whole longitude of Asia, naming and describing kingdom after
kingdom which he had seen with his own eyes; the Deserts of
Persia, the flowering plateaux and wild gorges of Badakshan, the
jade-bearing rivers of Khotan; the Mongolian steppes, <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>cradle of the
power that had so lately threatened to swallow up Christendom;
the new and brilliant Court that had been established at
Cambaluc: the first Traveller to reveal China in all its wealth
and vastness, its mighty rivers, its huge cities, its rich
manufactures, its swarming population, the inconceivably vast
fleets that quickened its seas and its inland waters; to tell us
of the nations on its borders, with all their eccentricities of
manners and worship; of Tibet, with its sordid devotees; of
Burma, with its golden pagodas and their tinkling crowns; of
Laos, of Siam, of Cochin China; of Japan, the Eastern Thule, with
its rosy pearls and golden-roofed palaces: the first to speak of
that Museum of Beauty and Wonder, still so imperfectly ransacked,
the Indian Archipelago, source of those aromatics then so highly
prized and whose origin was so dark; of Java, the Pearl of
Islands; of Sumatra, with its many kings, its strange costly
products, and its cannibal races; of the dusky savages of Nicobar
and Andaman; of Ceylon, the Isle of Gems, with its sacred
Mountain and its tomb of Adam; of India the Great, not as a
dreamland of Alexandrian fables, but as a country seen and
partially explored, with its virtuous Brahmans, its obscene
ascetics, its diamonds and the strange tales of their
acquisition, its sea-beds of pearl, and its powerful sun: the
first in medi&aelig;val times to give any distinct account of the
secluded Christian Empire of Abyssinia and the semi-Christian
island of Socotra; to speak, though indeed dimly, of Zanzibar,
with its negroes and its ivory, and of the vast and distant
Madagascar, bordering on the Dark <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Ocean of the South, with its Roc <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> and other monstrosities; and, in a
remotely opposite region, of Siberia and the Arctic Ocean, of
dog-sledges, white bears, and reindeer-riding
Tunguses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who can dispute the fame of a man whose name and memory are
associated with so marvellous a catalogue of discoveries, who
anticipated the travellers of a later generation in many of their
most remarkable enterprises?&nbsp; At one time, the authenticity
of his statements was frequently and openly impugned; he was
accused of exaggeration and inexactitude; but the labours of
Marsden, Pauthier, and especially of Colonel Yule, have shown
that his statements, so far as they are founded on personal
observation, may be implicitly accepted.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the early part of the fourteenth century there lived at
Venice a patrician of good family, named Andrea Polo, to whom
were born three sons, Marco, Nicolo, and Maffeo.&nbsp; Nicolo,
the second of these sons, was the father of our traveller, Marco
Polo, who was born in 1254.&nbsp; Engaged in extensive commercial
operations, Nicolo, soon after his son&rsquo;s birth, journeyed
to Constantinople, and thence proceeded on a trading venture to
the Crimea, which led to his ascending the Volga for a
considerable distance, and crossing the steppes to visit Bokhara
and the Court of the great Kublai Khan, on or within the borders
of Cathay.&nbsp; Kublai, the hero of so many legends, had never
before seen a European.&nbsp; He tendered to Nicolo and his
brother Maffeo (who travelled with <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>him) a right royal welcome; was deeply
interested in all they told him of the kingdoms and states of
Europe; and finally resolved on sending them back, with one of
his own nobles, as ambassadors to the Pope.&nbsp; In this
capacity they arrived at Acre in 1269; but as Pope Clement IV.
had died in the previous year, and no successor had as yet been
elected, the two brothers thought they might reasonably indulge
themselves in a visit to their Venetian homes, from which they
had been absent for fifteen years.</p>
<p>Nicolo remained at Venice until 1271, when, no Pope having
been elected, he deemed it well that he should return to the
Great Khan to explain the delay which had taken place in the
fulfilment of his mission.&nbsp; Accompanied by his brother
Maffeo, and his son Marco, a lad of seventeen, he sailed to Acre,
and thence to the port of Ayas on the gulf of Scanderoon, where
he was overtaken by the news that a Pope had at last been elected
in the person of an old friend of his, Tedoldo Visconti, or Pope
Gregory X., at that time legate in Syria.&nbsp; The new Pope
immediately sent for the two brothers to Acre, and charged them
with a cordial message for the Khan.&nbsp; He also sent him two
Dominican monks to teach the truths of science and Christianity;
but they took fright at an early stage of the journey, and
hurried back to Acre; while the two brothers, with young Polo,
started overland for the Court of the Great Khan.</p>
<p>Reaching Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, they seem
to have taken a northern route; traversing successively the
regions of Kerman and Khorasan, Balkh and Badakshan, and
ascending the <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>Upper Oxus to the great plateau of Pamir&mdash;a route
followed by no European traveller, except Benedict Goro, until it
was undertaken by Captain John Wood, of the Indian navy, in his
special expedition to the sources of the Oxus in 1838.&nbsp;
Leaving the bleak wastes of the Pamir, the Polos descended into
Kashgar, visited Yarkand and Khotand, passed near Lake Lob, and
eventually traversed the great Desert of the Gobi, since explored
by several European travellers, to Tangut, the name then applied
by Mongols and Persians to territory at the extreme north-west of
China, both within and without the famous Wall.&nbsp; Skirting
the Chinese frontier, they came upon the Great Khan at his summer
palace of Kaiping-fu, near the foot of the Khin-gan Mountains,
and about fifty miles north of the Great Wall.&nbsp; This must
have been in May, 1275, or thereabouts, when Marco Polo was close
upon one and twenty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king of kings&rdquo; received the three bold
Venetians with much favour.&nbsp; &ldquo;He showed great pleasure
at their coming, and asked many questions as to their welfare,
and how they had sped.&nbsp; They replied that they had in verity
sped well, seeing that they found the Khan well and safe.&nbsp;
Then they presented the credentials and letters which they had
received from the Pope, and those pleased him right well; and
after that they produced some sacred oil from the Holy Sepulchre,
whereat he was very glad, valuing it greatly.&nbsp; And next,
spying Marco, who was then a young gallant (<i>jeune
bacheler</i>), he asked who was that in their company.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sire,&rsquo; said his father, Messer Nicolo, &lsquo;he is
my son and your liegeman.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Welcome is he
too,&rsquo; quoth the Emperor.&nbsp; <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>But why should I make a long
story?&nbsp; There was great rejoicing at the Court because of
their arrival; and they met with attention and honour from
everybody.&nbsp; So there they abode at the Court with the other
barons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among young Marco Polo&rsquo;s gifts appears to have been a
facility for acquiring languages.&nbsp; He speedily mastered that
of the Tartars, so as both to write and speak it; and in a brief
space he came to know several other languages and four written
characters.&nbsp; He studied also the customs of the Tartars and
their mode of carrying on war.&nbsp; His ability and prudence
greatly recommended him to Kublai, and he began to employ him in
the public service.&nbsp; His first embassy was to a country
lying a six months journey distant; apparently the province of
Yun-nan, which he reached by way of Shansi, Shensi and
Szechuen.&nbsp; He had been shrewd enough to observe that the
Khan was disgusted with the rigid officialism of his ambassadors,
who, on returning from their various missions, would speak only
of the business they had transacted, whereas he would fain have
heard of the strange things, peoples, and countries they had
seen.&nbsp; And so he took full notes of all he saw, and returned
to the Khan&rsquo;s Court brimful of surprising information, to
which the prince listened with evident pleasure.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
this young man live,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he will assuredly
come to be a person of great work and capacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For seventeen years Marco Polo remained in the Khan&rsquo;s
service, being sent on several important embassies, and engaged
also in the domestic administration.&nbsp; For three years he
held the government of <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the important city of Yangchau.&nbsp;
On another occasion, with his uncle Maffeo, he spent a
twelvemonth at Kangchau in Tangut.&nbsp; He also visited
Karakorum, the old Mongolian capital of the Khans, and penetrated
into Champa, or Southern Cochin China.&nbsp; Finally, he seems to
have been sent on a mission to the Indian Seas, and to have
explored several of the southern states of India.&nbsp; And thus
it came about that Messer Marco Polo had knowledge of, or
actually visited, a greater number of the different countries of
the world than any other man; the more that he was always eager
to gain information, and to examine and inquire into
everything.</p>
<p>Meantime, the Venetians were growing wealthy, and
Marco&rsquo;s father and uncle were growing old; and increasing
wealth and increasing years raised in them an apprehension of
what might befall them in case of the aged Khan&rsquo;s death,
and a desire to return to their native land.&nbsp; Several times
they applied to Kublai for permission to depart; but he was loth
to say farewell to the men whom he had known and trusted so long,
and, but for an opportune event, they might never have succeeded
in carrying themselves and their jewels and gold back to
Europe.&nbsp; In 1286 Argh&uacute;n Khan, of Persia,
Kublai&rsquo;s great-nephew, lost his favourite wife, the Khatun
Bulagh&aacute;n.&nbsp; On her death-bed she charged him to supply
her place with a daughter of her own tribe, the Mongols of
Bayaut; and, desirous of fulfilling her dying wish, the bereaved
prince despatched three ambassadors to Kublai&rsquo;s Court to
seek for him a fitting bride.&nbsp; The Great Khan received them
with all honour and hospitality, and then sent for the lady
Kukachiu, a maiden of <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>seventeen, and a very beautiful and
gracious person.&nbsp; On her arrival at Court she was presented
to the three ambassadors, who declared that the lady pleased them
well.</p>
<p>The overland route from Peking to Tabriz was long and
dangerous, and the envoys decided, therefore, on returning, with
their fair charge, by sea.&nbsp; While sojourning at the
Khan&rsquo;s Court they had made the acquaintance of the three
Venetians, and being greatly impressed by their marvellous good
sense and experience, and by Marco Polo&rsquo;s extensive
knowledge of the Indian seas and territories, they entreated the
Khan to allow them the advantage and protection of their
company.&nbsp; It was with profound reluctance that Kublai gave
his consent; but when once he had done so, he behaved with his
wonted splendour of generosity.&nbsp; Summoning the three
Venetians to his presence, he placed in their hands two golden
&ldquo;tablets of authority,&rdquo; which secured them a free
passage through all his dominions, and unlimited supplies of all
necessaries for themselves and for their company.&nbsp; He
entrusted them also with messages to the King of France, the King
of England, the King of Spain, and other sovereigns of
Christendom.&nbsp; Then he caused thirteen ships to be equipped,
each with four masts and nine to twelve sails; and when all was
ready, the ambassadors and the lady, with the three Venetians,
took leave of the Great Khan, and went on board their ships, with
a large retinue, and with two years&rsquo; supplies provided by
the Emperor (<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1292).</p>
<p>The port from which they set out seems to have been that of
Zaytou, in Fo-kien.&nbsp; The voyage was long and wearisome, and
chequered by much ill <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>fortune; and in the course of it two
of the ambassadors died, and as many as six hundred of the
mariners and attendants.&nbsp; They were detained for months on
the coast of Sumatra, and in the south of India; nor did they
arrive at Hormuz until the end of 1293.&nbsp; There they learned
that Argh&uacute;n Khan had been dead a couple of years, and that
he had been succeeded by his brother Kaikhatu.&nbsp; The lady,
according to the custom of the country, became the wife of
Argh&uacute;n&rsquo;s son, Prince Ghazan, who is spoken of as
endowed with some of the highest qualities of a king, a soldier,
and a legislator; but she wept much in bidding farewell to her
noble Venetian friends.</p>
<p>As for Marco Polo, his father, and uncle, having discharged
the trust placed in their hands by Kublai Khan, they proceeded to
Tabriz, on a visit to Kaikhatu; and having sojourned there for
some months, journeyed homeward by way of Trebizond,
Constantinople, and Negropont, arriving in Venice in 1295, after
an absence of four and twenty years.</p>
<p>The traditional story of their arrival is related by
Ramusio:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years of anxiety and travel, and the hardships of many
journeys, had so changed the appearance of the three Venetians,
who, indeed, had almost forgotten their native tongue, that no
one in Venice recognized them.&nbsp; Their clothes, too, were
coarse and shabby, and after the Tartar fashion.&nbsp; Proceeding
to their house in Venice, a lofty and handsome palazzo, and known
by the name of the Corte del Millioni, they found it occupied by
some of their relatives, whom they had no small difficulty in
convincing of their identity.&nbsp; To secure the desired
recognition, and the <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>honourable notice of the whole city,
they adopted a quaint device.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inviting a number of their friends and kindred to an
entertainment, they were careful that it should be prepared with
great state and splendour; and when the hour came for sitting
down to table, they came forth from their chamber, all clothed in
crimson satin, fashioned in long robes reaching to the ground,
such as in those days people wore within doors.&nbsp; And when
water for ablutions had been served, and the guests were sat,
they doffed these robes, and put on others of crimson damask,
while the first suits were, by their orders, cut up and divided
among the servants.&nbsp; After partaking of some of the dishes,
they again retired, to come back resplendent in robes of crimson
velvet, and when they had again taken their seats, the cast-off
robes were divided as before.&nbsp; When dinner was over, they
did the like with the robes of velvet, after they had attired
themselves in dresses of the same fashion as those worn by the
rest of the company.&nbsp; Much wonder and astonishment did the
guests exhibit at these proceedings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, when the cloth had been removed, and all the
servants had quitted the dining-hall, Messer Marco, as the
youngest of the three, rose from table, and, going into another
chamber, brought forth the three shabby dresses of coarse stuff
which they had worn, on their arrival in the city.&nbsp;
Straightway, with sharp knives they began to rip some of the
seams and welts, and to draw forth vast quantities of jewels of
the highest value&mdash;rubies and sapphires, carbuncles,
diamonds, and emeralds&mdash;which had all been stitched up in
those dresses so <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>artfully that nobody could have suspected their
presence.&nbsp; For when they took leave of the Great Khan, they
had converted all the wealth he had bestowed upon them into this
mass of precious stones, being well aware of the impossibility of
carrying with them so great an amount in gold, over a journey of
such extreme length and difficulty.&nbsp; The exhibition of this
immense treasure of jewels and precious stones, all poured out
upon the table, threw the guests into fresh amazement, so that
they appeared bewildered and dumfounded.&nbsp; And straightway
they recognized, what they had formerly doubted, that the three
strangers were indeed those worthy and honoured gentlemen of the
Polo family whom they had claimed to be; and paid them the
greatest reverence.&nbsp; And the story being bruited abroad in
Venice, the whole city, gentle and simple, hastened to the house
to embrace them, and make much of them, with every demonstration
of affection and respect.&nbsp; On Messer Maffeo, the eldest,
they conferred an office that in those days was of high dignity;
while the young men came daily to visit and converse with the
ever polite and gracious Messer Marco, and to ask him questions
about Cathay and the Great Khan, all of which he answered with
such courtesy and kindliness, that every man felt himself in a
manner in his debt.&nbsp; And as it chanced that in the narrative
which he was constantly called on to repeat of the magnificence
of the Great Khan, he would speak of his revenues as amounting to
ten or fifteen &lsquo;millions&rsquo; of gold, and, in like
manner, when recounting other instances of great wealth in those
remote lands, would always employ the term
&lsquo;millions,&rsquo; people nicknamed him <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Messer Marco
<i>Millioni</i>&mdash;a circumstance which I have noted also in
the public books of this Republic where he is mentioned.&nbsp;
The court of his house, too, at S. Giovanni Crisostomo has always
from that time been popularly known as the Court of the
Millioni.&rdquo; <a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p>We pass on to 1298, a year which witnessed a fresh outburst of
the bitter enmity between Genoa and Venice.&nbsp; The Genoese,
intent upon crushing their formidable rival, despatched a great
fleet into the Adriatic, under the command of Lamba Doria.&nbsp;
Off the island of Curzola they were met by a more powerful
armada, of which Andrea Dandolo was admiral, and one of the
galleys of which was commanded by Marco Polo.&nbsp; The battle
began early on the 7th of September, the Venetians entering into
it with the glad confidence of victory.&nbsp; Their impetuous
attack was rewarded by the capture of the Genoese galleys; but,
dashing on too eagerly, many of their ships ran aground.&nbsp;
One of these was captured, cleared of its crew, and filled with
Genoese.&nbsp; Closing up into a column, the Genoese pushed the
encounter hotly, and broke through the Venetian line, which the
misadventure we have spoken of had thrown into disorder.&nbsp;
Throughout the long September day the fight was bravely
supported; but, towards sunset, a squadron of cruising ships
arriving to reinforce Doria, the Venetians were taken in flank,
and finally overpowered.&nbsp; The victory of the Genoese was
complete; they captured nearly all the Venetian vessels,
including <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>the admiral&rsquo;s, and seven thousand men, among whom
were Dandolo and Marco Polo.&nbsp; The former disappointed the
triumph of his victors by dashing out his brains against the side
of his galley; the latter was removed to Genoa.</p>
<p>During his captivity Polo made the acquaintance of a Pisan man
of letters, named Rusticiano, or Rustichello, who was a prisoner
like himself.&nbsp; When he learned the nature of Polo&rsquo;s
remarkable experiences, this Pisan gentleman, not unnaturally,
urged him to record them in writing; and it would seem that the
great traveller complied with the request, and dictated to his
new friend the narrative that has since excited so much curious
interest.&nbsp; Through the intervention of Matteo Visconti,
Captain-General of Milan, peace was concluded in May, 1299,
between Genoa and Venice, and as one of the conditions was the
release of prisoners on both sides, Messer Marco Polo soon
afterwards obtained his freedom, and returned to his family
mansion in the Corte del Sabbrin.&nbsp; He took with him the
manuscript story of his world wanderings, and in 1306 presented a
copy of it to a noble French knight, Thibault de Cipoy, who had
been sent on a diplomatic mission to Venice by Charles of
Valois.</p>
<p>The closing years of a life which, in its spring and summer,
had been crowded with incident and adventures, were undisturbed
by any notable event, and in his old age Marco Polo enjoyed the
sweetness of domestic peace and the respect of his
fellow-countrymen.&nbsp; On the 9th of January, 1324,
&ldquo;finding himself growing feebler every day through bodily
ailment, but being by the grace of God of a meek mind, and <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of senses and
judgment unimpaired, he made his will, in which he constituted as
his trustees Donata, his beloved wife, and his dear daughters,
Fantina, Bellola, and Monta,&rdquo; bequeathing to them the bulk
of his property.&nbsp; How soon afterwards he died, there is no
evidence to show; but it is at least certain that it was before
June, 1325.&nbsp; We may conclude, therefore, that his varied
life fulfilled the Psalmist&rsquo;s space of seventy years.</p>
<p>Marco Polo, says Martin Bucer, was the creator of the modern
geography of Asia.&nbsp; He was the Humboldt of the thirteenth
century; and the record of his travels must prove an imperishable
monument of his force of character, wide intelligence and
sympathy, and unshaken intrepidity.&nbsp; We have thus briefly
summarized his remarkable career, and indicated the general
extent of his travels.&nbsp; To follow him in detail throughout
his extensive journeys would be impossible within the limits
prescribed to us; and we shall content ourselves, therefore, with
such extracts from his narrative as will best illustrate their
more interesting and striking features, and indirectly assist us
in forming some conception of the man himself.</p>
<p>And first, we take his description of the great river of
Badakshan and the table-land of Pamir&mdash;which the wandering
Kirghiz call &ldquo;The Roof of the
World&rdquo;&mdash;substituting modern names of places for those
in the original.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;In leaving Badakshan, you ride twelve days between east
and north-east, ascending a river [the Upper Oxus] that runs
through land belonging to a brother of the Prince of Badakshan,
and containing a good <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>many towns and villages and scattered
habitations.&nbsp; The people are Mohammedans, and valiant in
war.&nbsp; At the end of those twelve days you come to a province
of no great size, extending indeed no more than three days&rsquo;
journey in any direction, and this is called Wakhan.&nbsp; The
people worship Mohammed, and have a peculiar language.&nbsp; They
are gallant soldiers, and have a chief whom they call <i>None</i>
[No-no?], which is as much as to say Count, and they are liegemen
to the Prince of Badakshan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are numbers of wild beasts of all kinds in this
region.&nbsp; And when you leave this little country, and ride
three days north-east, always among mountains, you get to such a
height that it is spoken of as the highest place in the
world.&nbsp; And when you reach this height, you find a great
lake between two mountains [Lake Sir-i-kol], and out of it a pure
river [the Oxus] flows through a plain clothed with the most
beautiful pasture in the world, so that a lean beast would fatten
there to your heart&rsquo;s content in ten days.&nbsp; There are
great numbers of all kinds of wild beasts; among others, wild
sheep of large size, with horns six palms in length [the Rass, or
<i>Ovis Poli</i>].&nbsp; From these horns the shepherds make
great bowls out of which to eat their food; and they use the
horns also to enclose folds for their cattle at night.&nbsp;
Messer Marco was told also that the wolves were numerous, and
killed many of those wild sheep.&nbsp; Hence quantities of their
horns and bones were found, and these were made into great heaps
by the wayside, in order to direct travellers when snow lay on
the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plain is called Pamir, and you ride across it for
twelve days together, finding nothing but a desert <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>without
habitation or any green thing, so that travellers are compelled
to carry with them whatever they have need of.&nbsp; The region
is so lofty and so cold, that not a bird is to be seen.&nbsp; And
I must also observe that, owing to this extreme cold, fire does
not burn so brightly, nor give out so much heat as usual, nor
does it cook food so thoroughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if we continue our journey towards the
east-north-east, we travel fully forty days, continually passing
over mountains and hills, or through valleys, and crossing many
rivers and wildernesses.&nbsp; And in all this extent you find
neither habitation of man, nor any green thing, and must carry
with you whatever you require.&nbsp; The country is called Bolor
[the Tibetan kingdom of Balti].&nbsp; The people dwell high up in
the mountains, and are savage idolaters, living only by the
chase, and clothing themselves in the skins of beasts.&nbsp; They
are, in truth, an evil race.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>[In February, 1838, Captain John Wood crossed the Pamir, and
his description of it may be compared with the Venetian
traveller&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;We stood, to use a native
expression,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;upon the
<i>B&aacute;ni-i-Duniah</i>, or &lsquo;Roof of the World,&rsquo;
while before us lay stretched a noble, but frozen sheet of water,
from whose western end issued the infant river of the Oxus.&nbsp;
This fine lake (Sir-i-kol) lies in the form of a crescent, about
fourteen miles long from east to west, by an average breadth of
one mile.&nbsp; On three sides it is bordered by swelling hills
about 500 feet high, while along its southern bank they rise into
mountains 3500 feet above the lake, or 19,000 feet above the sea,
and covered with perpetual snow, from which never-failing source
the <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>lake
is supplied.&nbsp; Its elevation is 15,600 feet. . . .&nbsp; The
appearance of the country presented the image of a winter of
extreme severity.&nbsp; Wherever one&rsquo;s gaze rested, a
dazzling bed of snow covered the soil like a carpet, while the
sky above our heads was of a sombre and melancholy hue.&nbsp; A
few clouds would have refreshed the eye, but none could be
anywhere seen.&nbsp; Not a breath rippled the surface of the
lake; not a living animal, not even a bird, presented itself to
the view.&nbsp; The sound of a human voice had been harmonious
music to the ear, but, at this inhospitable season of the year,
no one ventured into these icy realms.&nbsp; Silence reigned
everywhere around us; a silence so profound that it oppressed the
heart.&rdquo; <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Of the city of Lop (or Lob) and the great Desert of Gobi,
Marco Polo writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lop is a large town on the border of the desert which
is called the Desert of Lop, and is situated between east and
north-east.&nbsp; It belongs to the Great Khan, and the people
worship Mohammed.&nbsp; Now, such persons as propose to cross the
desert take a week&rsquo;s rest in this town to refresh
themselves and their cattle; and then they make ready for the
journey, taking with them a month&rsquo;s supply for man and
beast.&nbsp; On quitting this city they enter the desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The extent of this desert is so great, that it is said
it would take a year and more to ride from one end of it to the
other.&nbsp; And here, where its breadth <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>is least, it
takes a month to cross it.&nbsp; It is all composed of hills and
valleys of sand, and contains not a thing to eat.&nbsp; But after
riding for a day and a night you find fresh water, enough mayhap
for some fifty or one hundred persons with their beasts, but not
for more.&nbsp; And all across the desert you will find water in
like manner, that is to say, in some twenty-eight places
altogether you will find good water, but in no great quantity;
and in four places also you find brackish water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beasts there are none; for there is no food for
them.&nbsp; But there is a marvellous thing related of this
desert, which is that when travellers are on the march by night,
and one of them chances to drop behind, or to fall asleep or the
like, when he tries to regain his company, he will hear spirits
talking, and suppose them to be his comrades.&nbsp; Sometimes the
spirits will call him by name; and thus shall a traveller
frequently be led astray so that he never finds his party.&nbsp;
And in this way many have perished.&nbsp; Sometimes the
travellers will hear as it were the tramp and murmur of a great
cavalcade of people away from the real line of road, and taking
this to be their own company, will follow the sound; and when day
breaks they discover the deception, and perceive that they are in
an evil plight.&nbsp; Even in the day time the spirits may be
heard talking.&nbsp; And sometimes you shall hear the sound of
various musical instruments, and still more commonly the rattle
of drums.&nbsp; Hence, in performing this journey, it is
customary for travellers to keep close together.&nbsp; All the
animals, too, have bells at their necks, so that they cannot
easily get astray.&nbsp; <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>And at sleeping time a signal is
hoisted to show the direction of the next march.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in this way it is that the desert is
crossed.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As the sea has its mermaids, and the river its water-sprites,
Undines, or Loreleys, which entice their victims to death, so the
deserts and waste places of the earth have their goblins and
malignant demons.&nbsp; The awe inspired by the vastness and
dreary solitude of the wilderness suggests to the imagination
only gloomy ideas, and it is conceived of as a place where no
influences or beings favourable to man can exist.&nbsp; Its
sounds are sounds of terror; its appearances all foster a
sentiment of mystery.&nbsp; Pliny tells us of the phantoms that
start up before the traveller in the African deserts;
Mas&rsquo;udi, of the Gh&ucirc;ls, which in night and solitude
seek to lead him astray.&nbsp; An Arab writer relates a tradition
of the Western Sahara:&mdash;&ldquo;If the wayfarer be alone the
demons make sport of him, and fascinate him, so that he wanders
from his course and perishes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Colonel Yule remarks
that the Afghan and Persian wildernesses also have their
<i>Gh&ucirc;l-i-Be&aacute;ban</i>, or Goblin of the Waste, a
gigantic and fearful spectre which devours travellers; and even
the Gaels of the West Highlands have the desert creature of Glen
Eiti, which, one-handed, one-eyed, one-legged, seems exactly to
answer to the Arabian Nes&uacute;as or <i>Empusa</i>.&nbsp; And
it may be added that the wind-swept wastes of Dartmoor, limited
as is their expanse, are, in the eyes of the peasantry, haunted
by mysterious and malevolent spirits.</p>
<p>The effect of the Desert on a cultivated mind is well
described by Madame Hommaire de Hell:&mdash;&ldquo;The <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>profound
stillness,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;which reigns in the air
produces an indescribable impression on our senses.&nbsp; We
scarcely dare to interrupt it, it seems so solemn, so fully in
harmony with the infinite grandeur of the desert.&nbsp; In vain
will you seek a calm so absolute in even the remotest solitudes
of civilized countries.&nbsp; Everywhere some spring murmurs,
everywhere some trees rustle, everywhere in the silence of the
nights some voices are heard which arrest the thought; but here
nature is, so to speak, petrified, and we have before us the
image of that eternal repose which the mind is hardly able to
conceive.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Concerning the customs of the Tartars, Marco Polo
writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Tartar custom is to spend the winter in warm plains
where they find good fodder for their cattle, while in summer
they betake themselves to a cool climate among the mountains and
valleys, where water is to be found, as well as woods and
pastures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their houses are circular, and are made of wands
covered with felt.&nbsp; These are carried along with them
whithersoever they go; for the wands are so strongly interwoven,
and so well combined, that the framework can be made very
light.&nbsp; Whenever these huts are erected, the door is always
placed to the south.&nbsp; They also have waggons covered with
black felt so efficaciously that no rain can enter.&nbsp; These
are drawn by oxen and camels, and the women and children travel
in them.&nbsp; The women do the buying and selling, and whatever
is necessary to provide for the husband and household; for the
men <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>all
lead the life of gentlemen, troubling themselves about nothing
but hawking and hunting, and looking after their goshawks and
falcons, unless it be the practice of warlike exercises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They live on the meat and milk which their birds
supply, and on the produce of the chase; and they eat all kinds
of flesh, including that of horses and dogs, and Pharaoh&rsquo;s
rats, of which there are great numbers in burrows on these
plains.&nbsp; Their drink is mare&rsquo;s milk. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the fashion of their religion: They say there
is a most high God of Heaven, whom they worship daily with
thurible and incense, but they pray to him only for health of
mind and body.&nbsp; But they have also a certain other god of
theirs called Natigay, and they say he is the God of the Earth,
who watches over their children, cattle, and crops.&nbsp; They
show him great worship and honour, and every man hath a figure of
him in his house, made of felt and cloth; and they also make in
the same manner images of his wife and children.&nbsp; The wife
they put on the left hand, and the children in front.&nbsp; And
when they eat, they take the fat of the meat and grease the
god&rsquo;s mouth withal, as well as the mouths of his wife and
children.&nbsp; Then they take of the broth and sprinkle it
before the door of the house; and that done, they deem that their
god and his family have had their share of the dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their drink is mare&rsquo;s milk, prepared in such a
way that you would take it for white wine, and a good right drink
it is, called by them komiz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The clothes of the wealthy Tartars are for the most
part of gold and silk stuffs, lined with costly furs, <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>such as sable
and ermine, vair and fox skin, in the richest fashion.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As in succeeding chapters of this volume we shall have
something to say about the manners and customs of the Mongolian
nomads, we may here be content with observing that Marco
Polo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Natigay&rdquo; seems identical with the
&ldquo;Nongait&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ongotiu&rdquo; of the Buriats,
who, according to Pallas, is honoured by them as the tutelary god
of sheep and other cattle.&nbsp; Properly the divinity consists
of <i>two</i> figures, hanging side by side, one of whom
represents the god&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; These two figures are
merely a pair of lanky flat bolsters with the upper part shaped
into a round disc, and the body hung with a long woolly fleece;
eyes, nose, breasts, and navel being indicated by leather knobs
stitched upon the surface.&nbsp; The male figure commonly has at
his girdle the foot-rope with which horses at pasture are
fettered, whilst the female, which is sometimes accompanied by
smaller figures representing her children, is adorned with all
sorts of little nick-nacks and sewing implements.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Tartar customs of war are thus described:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All their harness of war is excellent and costly.&nbsp;
Their arms are bows and arrows, sword and mace; but, above all,
the bow, for they are capital archers, indeed the best that are
known.&nbsp; On their backs they wear armour of cuirbouly, <a
name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a> prepared from buffalo and other hides,
which is very strong.&nbsp; They are excellent soldiers, and
passing valiant in battle.&nbsp; <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>They are also more capable of
hardship than other nations; for many a time, if need be, they
will go for a month without any supply of food, living only on
the milk of their mares and on such game as their bows may win
them.&nbsp; Their horses also will subsist entirely on the grass
of the plains, so that there is no need to carry store of barley,
or straw, or oats; and they are very docile to their
riders.&nbsp; These, in case of need, will abide on horseback the
livelong night, armed at all points, while the horse will be
continually grazing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all troops in the world these are they which endure
the greatest hardship and fatigue, and cost the least; and they
are the best of all for making wide conquests of country.&nbsp;
And there can be no manner of doubt that now they are the masters
of the larger half of the world.&nbsp; Their armies are admirably
ordered in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, when a Tartar prince goes forth to war, he
takes with him, say, a hundred thousand horse.&nbsp; Well, he
appoints an officer to every ten men, one to every hundred, one
to every thousand, and one to every ten thousand, so that his own
orders have to be given to ten persons only, and each of these
persons has to pass the orders only to other ten, and so on; none
having to give orders to more than ten.&nbsp; And every one in
turn is responsible only to the officer immediately over him; and
the discipline and order that comes of this method is marvellous,
for they are a people very obedient to their chiefs. . . .&nbsp;
And when the army is on the march they have always two hundred
horsemen, very well mounted, who are sent a distance of two
marches in advance to <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>reconnoitre, and these always keep
ahead.&nbsp; They have a similar party detached in the rear and
on either flank, so that there is a good look-out kept on all
sides against surprise.&nbsp; When they are going on a distant
expedition, they take no gear with them except two leather
bottles for milk, and a little earthenware pot to cook their meat
in, and a little tent to shelter them from rain.&nbsp; And in
case of great urgency, they will ride ten days on end without
lighting a fire or taking a meal.&nbsp; On such an occasion they
will sustain themselves on the blood of their horses, opening a
vein and letting the blood jet into their mouths, drinking till
they have had enough, and then staunching it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They also have milk dried into a kind of paste to carry
with them; and when they need food, they put this in water, and
beat it up till it dissolves, and then drink it.&nbsp; It is
prepared in this way: They boil the milk, and when the rich part
floats on the top they skim it into another vessel, and of that
they make butter; for the milk will not become solid till this is
removed.&nbsp; Then they put the milk in the sun to dry.&nbsp;
And when they go on an expedition, every man takes some ten
pounds of this dried milk with him.&nbsp; And of a morning he
will take a half-pound of it and put it in his leather bottle,
with as much water as he pleases.&nbsp; So, as he rides along,
the milk-paste and the water in the bottle get well churned
together into a kind of pap, and that makes his dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they come to an engagement with the enemy, they
will gain the victory in this fashion: They never let themselves
get into a regular medley, but keep perpetually riding round and
shooting into the <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>enemy.&nbsp; And as they do not count it any shame to
run away in battle, they will sometimes pretend to do so, and in
running away they turn in the saddle and shoot hard and strong at
the foe, and in this way make great havoc.&nbsp; Their horses are
trained so perfectly that they will double hither and thither,
just like a dog, in a way that is quite astonishing.&nbsp; Thus
they fight to as good purpose in running away as if they stood
and faced the enemy, because of the vast volleys of arrows that
they shoot in this way, turning round upon their pursuers, who
are fancying that they have won the battle.&nbsp; But when the
Tartars see that they have killed and wounded a good many horses
and men, they wheel round bodily, and return to the charge in
perfect order, and with loud cries; and in a very short time the
enemy are routed.&nbsp; In truth, they are stout and valiant
soldiers, and inured to war.&nbsp; And you perceive that it is
just when the enemy sees them run, and imagines that he has
gained the battle, that he has in reality lost it; for the
Tartars wheel round in a moment when they judge the right time
has come.&nbsp; And after this fashion they have won many a
fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this that I have been telling you is true of the
manners and customs of the genuine Tartars.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We come next to the magnificent city of Chandu&mdash;that is,
Shangtu, or &ldquo;Upper Towa,&rdquo; the Chinese title of Kublai
Khan&rsquo;s summer palace at Kaiping-fu.&nbsp; The ruins, both
of the city and palace, were extant as late as the end of the
seventeenth century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have ridden three days from the city of Chagan
Nor [Chagan Balghassan], between <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>north-east and north, you come to a
city called Chandu, which was built by the Khan now
reigning.&nbsp; There is at this place a very fine marble palace,
the rooms of which are all gilt and painted with figures of men
and beasts and birds, and with a variety of trees and flowers,
all wrought with such exquisite art that you regard them with
delight and astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Round this palace is built a wall, enclosing a compass
of sixteen miles, and inside the park are fountains and rivers
and brooks and beautiful meadows, with all kinds of wild animals
(excluding such as are of ferocious nature), which the Emperor
has produced and placed there to supply food for the gerfalcons
and hawks which he keeps in mew.&nbsp; Of these the gerfalcons
alone number more than two hundred, without reckoning the other
hawks.&nbsp; The Khan himself goes every week to see his birds
sitting in mew, and sometimes he rides through the park with a
leopard behind him on his horse&rsquo;s croup; and then, if he
sees any animal that takes his fancy, he lets loose his leopard
at it, and the game when taken is used to feed the hawks in
mew.&nbsp; This he does for diversion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Further, at a point in the park where blooms a
delightful wood, he has another palace built of bamboo, of which
I must give you a description.&nbsp; It is gilt all over, and
most elaborately finished inside.&nbsp; It is supported on gilt
and lackered columns, on each of which stands a dragon all gilt,
the tail being attached to the column, while the head uplifts the
architrave, and the claws likewise being extended right and left
as props to the architrave.&nbsp; The roof also is formed of
bamboo, covered with a varnish so good and strong that no amount
of rain will rot it.&nbsp; <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>These canes are fully three palms in
girth, and from ten to fifteen paces in length.&nbsp; They are
cut across at each knot, and the pieces are then split so as to
form from each two hollow tiles, and with them the house is
roofed; only every such tile has to be nailed down to prevent the
wind from lifting it.&nbsp; In short, the whole palace is built
of these bamboos, which, I may mention, are employed for a great
variety of other useful purposes.&nbsp; The construction of the
palace is such that it can be taken down and put up again with
great rapidity; and it can be removed to any place which he may
desire.&nbsp; When erected, it is held up by more than two
hundred (200) ropes of silk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Emperor resides in this park of his, sometimes in
the palace of marble, and sometimes in that of bamboo, for three
mouths of the year, namely, June, July, and August; preferring
this abode because it is by no means hot; in fact, it is very
cool.&nbsp; When the 28th day of August arrives he takes his
departure, and the bamboo palace is pulled to pieces.&nbsp; But I
must tell you what happens when he takes his departure every year
on the 28th of August.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know that the Khan keeps an immense stud of
white horses and mares; in truth, upwards of two hundred of them,
and all pure white without a blemish.&nbsp; The milk of these
mares is drunk by himself and family, and by no one else, except
by the people of one great tribe who have also the privilege of
drinking it&mdash;a privilege granted to them by Chingis Khan, on
account of a certain victory which, long ago, they helped him to
win.&nbsp; The name of the tribe is Horiad [the Uirad or
Oirad].</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, when these mares are passing across the <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>country, and
any one falls in with them, be he the greatest lord in the land,
he must not presume to pass until the mares have gone by; he must
either tarry where he is, or go a half-day&rsquo;s round if so
need be, so as not to come nigh them; for they are to be treated
with the greatest respect.&nbsp; Well, when the Emperor sets out
from the park on the 28th of August, as I have told you, the milk
of all those mares is taken and sprinkled on the ground.&nbsp;
And this is done at the bidding of the idolaters and
idol-priests, who say that it is an excellent thing to sprinkle
that milk on the ground every 28th of August, so that the earth
and the air and the false gods shall have their share of it, and
the spirits likewise that inhabit the air and the earth.&nbsp;
And thus those beings will protect and bless the Khan, and his
children, and his wives, and his folk, and his gear, his cattle
and his horses, his corn, and all that is his.&nbsp; After this
is done, the Emperor is off and away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must now tell you a strange thing that hitherto I
have omitted to mention.&nbsp; During the three months of every
year that the Khan resides at that place, if it should chance to
be bad weather, there are certain crafty enchanters and
astrologers in his train who are such adepts in necromancy and
the diabolic arts, that they are able to prevent any cloud or
storm from traversing the spot whereon the imperial palace
stands.&nbsp; The sorcerers who do this are called Icbit and
Kesomin, which are the names of two nations of idolaters.&nbsp;
Whatever they do in this way is by the help of the devil, but
they make these people believe that it is compassed by their own
sanctity and the help of God.&nbsp; They always go in a <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>state of dirt
and uncleanness, devoid of respect for themselves, or for those
who see them, unwashed, unkempt, and sordidly attired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people have another custom which I must describe
to you.&nbsp; If a man is condemned to death, and executed by the
lawful authority, they take his body, and cook and eat it.&nbsp;
But if any one die a natural death, then they will not eat his
body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another marvel performed by these Bacsi
[<i>Bakhshi</i>, or <i>Bhikshu</i>], of whom I have spoken as
skilled in so many enchantments.&nbsp; For when the Great Khan is
at his capital and in his great palace, seated at his table,
which stands on a platform some eight cubits above the ground,
his cups are set before him on a great buffet in the middle of
the hall pavement, at a distance of some ten paces from his
table, and filled with wine, or other good spiced liquor such as
they use.&nbsp; Now, when the lord desires to drink, these
necromancers, by the power of their enchantments, cause the cups
to move from their place without being touched by anybody, and to
present themselves to the Emperor!&nbsp; This every one present
may witness, and ofttimes there are more than two thousand
persons present.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a truth, and no lie; and so
will the sages of your own country who understand necromancy,
tell you, for they also can perform this marvel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the idol festivals come round, these Bacsi go
to the prince and say, &lsquo;Sire, the feast of such a god is
come&rsquo; (naming him).&nbsp; &lsquo;My lord, you know,&rsquo;
the enchanter will say, &lsquo;that this god, when he gets no
offerings, always sends bad weather and spoils our seasons.&nbsp;
So we pray you to give us such <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>and such a number of black-faced
sheep&rsquo; (naming whatever number they please).&nbsp;
&lsquo;And we also beg, good my lord, that we may have such a
quantity of incense, and such a quantity of lign-aloes,
and&rsquo;&mdash;so much of this, so much of that, and so much of
t&rsquo;other, according to their fancy&mdash;&lsquo;that we may
perform a solemn service and a great sacrifice to our idols, and
that so they may be induced to protect us and all that is
ours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bacsi say these things to the nobles entrusted with
the stewardship, who stand round the Great Khan, and then repeat
them to the Khan, and he then orders the nobles to give to the
Bacsi anything they have demanded.&nbsp; And when they have
received the articles, they go and make a great feast in honour
of their god, and hold grand ceremonies of worship, with grand
illuminations and quantities of incense of a variety of odours,
which they make up from different aromatic spices.&nbsp; And then
they cook the meat, and set it before the idols, and sprinkle
their broth hither and thither, saying that in this way the idols
obtain their bellyful.&nbsp; In this way it is that they keep
their festivals.&nbsp; You must know that each idol has a name of
his own, and a feast-day, just as our saints have their
anniversaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have also immense minsters and monasteries, some
as big as a small town, with upwards of two thousand monks, so to
speak, in a single monastery.&nbsp; These monks dress more
decently than the rest of the people, and shave the head and
beard.&nbsp; Some among these Bacsi are allowed by their rule to
take wives, and they have plenty of children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another kind of devotees is the Sunni, who are <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>more
remarkable for their abstemiousness, and lead a life of such
austerity as I will describe.&nbsp; All their life long they eat
only bran, which they take mixed with hot water.&nbsp; That is
their food; bran, and nothing but bran; with water for their
drink.&nbsp; Their life is one long fast; so I may well speak of
its asceticism as extraordinary.&nbsp; They have great idols, and
very many; but they sometimes also worship fire.&nbsp; The other
idolaters who are not also of this sect call these people
heretics&mdash;<i>Palamis</i>, as we should say&mdash;because
they do not worship the idols after their fashion.&nbsp; Those of
whom I am now speaking would not take a wife on any
consideration.&nbsp; They wear dresses of hempen stuff, black and
blue, and sleep upon mats; in fact, their asceticism is something
astonishing.&nbsp; Their idols are all feminine; that is, they
bear women&rsquo;s names.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>[It was after reading Marco Polo&rsquo;s account of the Great
Khan&rsquo;s palace, as it is given in Purchas&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Pilgrims,&rdquo; that the poet Coleridge, falling asleep,
dreamed his melodious dream of Kublai&rsquo;s Paradise.&nbsp;
When he awoke he was able to recall a portion of it, beginning
thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br />
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran,<br />
By caverns measureless to man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down to a sunless sea.<br />
So twice five inches of fertile ground<br />
With walls and towers were girdled round;<br />
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br />
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br />
And here were forests, ancient as the hills,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.&rdquo;]</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>The
principal palace of the Great Khan was situated, however, at
Cambaluc (the modern Peking), and is thus described by our
Venetian:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is enclosed all round by a great wall, forming a
square, each side of which is a mile in length; that is to say,
the whole compass thereof is four miles.&nbsp; This you may
depend on; it is also very thick, and a good ten paces in height,
whitewashed and loop-holed all round.&nbsp; At each angle of the
wall is situated a very fine and rich palace, in which the war
harness of the Emperor is kept, such as bows and quivers, saddles
and bridles, and bowstrings, and everything needful for an
army.&nbsp; Also, midway between every two of these corner
palaces is another of the like; so that, taking the whole circuit
of the enclosed, you will find eight vast palaces stored with the
great lord&rsquo;s harness of war.&nbsp; And you must understand
that each palace is reserved for only one kind of article; one
being stored with bows, a second with saddles, a third with
bridles, and so on, in succession, right round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great wall has five gates on its southern face, the
central being the great gate, which is opened only for the egress
or admission of the Great Khan himself.&nbsp; Close on either
side is a smaller one, through which all other people pass; and
then, towards each angle, is another great gate, also open to
people in general; so that on that side are five gates in
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside of this wall is a second, enclosing a space that
is somewhat longer than it is broad.&nbsp; This enclosure has its
eight palaces also, corresponding to those of the outer wall, and
stored like them with <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>the Emperor&rsquo;s harness of
war.&nbsp; There are likewise five gates on the southern face,
answering to those in the outer wall; and one gate on each of the
other faces.&nbsp; In the centre of the second enclosure stands
the Emperor&rsquo;s Great Palace, and I will tell you what it is
like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know that it is the greatest palace ever
erected.&nbsp; Towards the north it is in contact with the outer
wall, while towards the south lies a vacant space which the
nobles and the soldiers are constantly traversing.&nbsp; The
palace itself hath no upper story, but is all on the ground
floor; only the basement is raised some ten palms above the
surrounding soil.&nbsp; And this elevation is retained by a wall
of marble raised to the level of the pavement, two paces in
width, and projecting beyond the base of the palace so as to form
a kind of terrace-walk, by which people can pass round the
building, and this is exposed to view; while along the outer edge
of the wall runs a very fine pillared balustrade, up to which the
people are allowed to come.&nbsp; The roof is very lofty, and the
walls are covered with gold and silver.&nbsp; They are also
adorned with representations of dragons, sculptured and gilt,
beasts and birds, knights and idols, and divers other
subjects.&nbsp; And on the ceiling, too, can nothing be seen but
gold and silver and painting.&nbsp; On each of the four sides is
a great marble staircase, leading to the top of the marble wall,
and forming the approach to the palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hall of the palace is so large that it could easily
dine six thousand people; and it is quite a marvel to see how
many rooms there are besides.&nbsp; The building is altogether so
vast, so rich, and so <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>beautiful, that no man on earth could
design anything superior to it.&nbsp; The outside of the roof
also is all coloured with vermilion and yellow and green and blue
and other hues, which are fixed with a varnish so fine and
exquisite, that they shine like crystal, and lend a resplendent
lustre to the palace, visible far around.&nbsp; This roof is so
solidly and strongly constructed that it is fit to last for
ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the inner side of the palace are large buildings
with halls and chambers, where the Emperor&rsquo;s private
property is placed, such as his treasures of gold, silver, gems,
pearls, and gold plate, and in which the ladies and concubines
reside.&nbsp; He occupies himself there at his own convenience,
and no one else has access to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between the two walls of the enclosure which I have
described are two fine parks, and beautiful trees bearing a
variety of fruits.&nbsp; There are beasts also of sundry kinds,
such as white stags and fallow deer, gazelles and roebucks, and
fine squirrels of various kinds, with numbers also of the animal
that gives the musk, and all manner of other beautiful creatures,
insomuch that the whole place is full of them, and no spot
remains void except where there is traffic of people going to and
fro.&nbsp; The parks are covered with abundant grass; and the
roads through them being all paved and raised two cubits above
the surface, they never become muddy, nor does the rain lodge on
them, but flows off into the meadows, quickening the soil and
producing that fertility of herbage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the north-western corner of the enclosure extends
a fine lake, containing abundance of fish of different kinds,
which the Emperor hath caused to be <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>put in there, so that, whenever he
desires any, he can have them at his pleasure.&nbsp; A river
enters this lake and issues from it; but a grating of iron or
brass is put up to prevent the escape of the fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, about a bowshot from the north side of the
palace is an artificial hill, made with the earth out of the
lake; it is a good hundred paces in height, and a mile in
compass, and is entirely covered with evergreen trees which never
lose their leaves.&nbsp; And I assure you that wherever a
beautiful tree exists, and the Emperor hears of it, he sends for
it and has it transported bodily, with all its roots and the
earth attached to them, and planted upon his hill.&nbsp; No
matter how huge the tree may be, he has it carried by his
elephants, and in this way he has formed the finest collection of
trees in all the world.&nbsp; And he has also caused the whole
hill to be covered with ore of azure, <a name="citation35"></a><a
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a> which is very
green.&nbsp; And thus not only are the trees all green, but the
hill itself is all green likewise; and there is nothing to be
seen on it that is not green; and hence it is called the Green
Mount; and, in good sooth, it is well named.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the top of the hill, too, stands a fair large
palace, which is all green outside and in, so that the hill, and
the trees, and the palace form together a charming spectacle; and
it is wonderful to see their uniformity of colour.&nbsp;
Everybody who sees it is delighted.&nbsp; And the Great Khan has
ordered this beautiful prospect for the comfort, solace, and
delectation of his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know that besides the palace I have <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>been
describing, <i>i.e.</i> the Great Palace, the Emperor has caused
another to be built, resembling his own in every respect; and
this he has done for his son, when he shall reign and be Emperor
after him.&nbsp; Hence it is made just in the same fashion, and
of the same size, so that everything can be carried on in the
same manner after his death.&nbsp; It stands on the other side of
the lake from the Great Khan&rsquo;s palace, and a bridge is
thrown across from one to the other.&nbsp; The prince I speak of
holds now a seal of empire, but not with such complete authority
as the Great Khan, who remains supreme as long as he
lives.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Let us now accompany the Emperor on a hunting
expedition:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After he has sojourned in his capital city for three
months, December, January, and February, the Great Khan starts on
the first day of March, and travels southward towards the Ocean
Sea, a two days&rsquo; journey.&nbsp; He takes with him fully ten
thousand falconers and some five hundred falcons, besides
peregrines, sakers, and other hawks in great number; and goshawks
also, for flying at the water-fowl.&nbsp; But do not suppose that
he keeps all these together by him; they are distributed hither
and thither, one hundred together, or two hundred at the utmost,
as he thinks proper.&nbsp; But they are always fowling as they
advance, and the greater part of the quarry taken is carried to
the Emperor.&nbsp; And let me tell you, when he goes thus
a-fowling with his gerfalcons and other hawks, he is attended by
fully ten thousand men, who are placed in couples; and these are
called <i>Toscach</i>, which is as much as to say,
&lsquo;Watchers.&rsquo;&nbsp; The name describes <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>their
business.&nbsp; They are posted from spot to spot, always in
couples, so that they cover a good deal of ground.&nbsp; Each of
them is provided with whistle and hood, so as to be able to call
in a hawk, and hold it in hand.&nbsp; And when the Emperor makes
a cast, there in no need that he should follow it up, for the men
I speak of keep so close a watch that they never lose sight of
the birds, if the hawks require help, they are ready to render
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Emperor&rsquo;s hawks, as well as those of the
nobles, have a little label attached to the leg to mark them,
whereon are written the names of the owner and the keeper of the
bird.&nbsp; So that the hawk, when caught, is at once identified,
and handed over to its owner.&nbsp; But if not, the bird is
carried to a certain noble, styled the <i>Bulargachi</i>, that
is, &lsquo;the Keeper of Lost Property.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I tell
you that anything found without a proper owner, whether horse,
sword, or hawk, or what not, is taken immediately to that
official, and he holds it in charge.&nbsp; Should the finder
neglect to carry his trover to the Bulargachi, the latter
punishes him.&nbsp; Likewise, the loser of any article goes to
him, and should it be in his hands, he immediately gives it up to
its owner.&nbsp; Moreover, the said noble always pitches on the
highest point of the camp, with his banner displayed, in order
that those who have lost or found should have no difficulty in
making their way to him.&nbsp; Thus, nothing can be lost without
being quickly found and restored. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Emperor, on his journey, is borne upon four
elephants in a fine pavilion made of timber, lined inside with
plates of beaten gold, and outside with lion&rsquo;s skins.&nbsp;
He always travels in this fashion on his <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>hunting
expeditions, because he is troubled with gout.&nbsp; He
invariably keeps beside him a dozen of his choicest gerfalcons,
and is attended by several of his nobles, who ride on horseback
by his side.&nbsp; And sometimes, as they go along, and the
Emperor from his chamber is discoursing with his nobles, one of
the latter will exclaim, &lsquo;Sire, look out for
cranes!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the Emperor has the top of his chamber
instantly thrown open, and, having marked the cranes, he casts
one of his gerfalcons, whichever he pleases; and often the quarry
is struck in his sight, so that he has the most exquisite sport
and diversion, as he sits in his chamber or lies on his bed; and
all the nobles in attendance share the enjoyment with him!&nbsp;
So it is not without reason I tell you that I do not believe
there ever existed in the world, or will exist, a man with such
sport and enjoyment as he has, or with such rare
opportunities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he has travelled until he reaches a place
called Cachar Modem, there he finds his tents pitched, with the
tents of his sons, and his nobles, and those of his ladies, and
their attendants, so that there shall be fully ten thousand in
all, and all costly and handsome.&nbsp; And I will tell you how
his own quarters are disposed.&nbsp; The tent in which he held
his courts is large enough to accommodate a thousand
persons.&nbsp; It is pitched with its door to the south, and the
nobles and knights remain in attendance in it, while the Emperor
abides in another close to it on the west side.&nbsp; When he
wishes to speak with any person, he causes him to be summoned to
the great tent.&nbsp; Immediately behind the latter is a spacious
chamber, where he sleeps. . . .&nbsp; The two audience-tents and
the <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>sleeping-chamber are thus constructed:&mdash;Each of the
audience-tents has three poles, which are of spice-wood, and most
artfully covered with lion&rsquo;s skins, striped with black and
white and red, so that they do not suffer from any weather.&nbsp;
All three apartments are also covered outside with similar skins
of striped lions, a substance that lasts for ever.&nbsp; Inside
they are lined with sable and ermine, which are the finest and
costliest furs in existence. . . .&nbsp; All the tent-ropes are
of silk.&nbsp; In short, I may say that these tents, namely, the
two halls of audience and the sleeping-chamber, are so costly,
that it is not every king could afford to pay for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Round about these tents are others, also fine ones and
beautifully pitched, in which abide the imperial ladies, and the
ladies of the different princes and officers.&nbsp; Tents are
there also for the hawks and their keepers, so that altogether
the number of tents on the plain is something wonderful.&nbsp; To
see the many people who are thronging to and fro on every side
and every day there, you would take the camp for a good large
city.&nbsp; For you must include the physicians and astrologers
and falconers, and all the other attendants on so numerous a
company; and add that everybody has his own household with him,
for such is their custom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There until the spring the Emperor remains encamped,
and all that time he does nothing but go hawking among the cane
brakes that fringe the abundant lakes and rivers in that region,
and across broad plains plentifully frequented by cranes and
swans, and all other kinds of fowl.&nbsp; Nor are the rest of the
nobles of the camp ever weary of hunting and <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>hawking, and
daily they bring home great store of venison and feathered game
of every kind.&nbsp; Indeed, unless you witnessed it, you would
never believe what quantities of game are taken, and what
marvellous sport and diversion they have while residing there in
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing I must mention, namely, that for twenty
days&rsquo; journey round the spot nobody is allowed, whoever he
may be, to keep hawks or hounds, though anywhere else whoever
chooses may keep them.&nbsp; And furthermore, throughout all the
Emperor&rsquo;s territories, nobody, however audacious, dares to
hunt any of these four animals, namely, hare, stag, buck, and
roe, from the month of March to the month of October.&nbsp;
Whoever should do so would rue it bitterly.&nbsp; But these
people are so obedient to their Emperor&rsquo;s commands, that
even if a man were to find one of those animals asleep by the
roadside, he would not touch it for the world.&nbsp; And thus the
game multiplies at such a rate, that the whole country swarms
with it, and obtains as much as he could desire.&nbsp; Beyond the
time I have mentioned, however, to wit, that from March to
October, everybody may take these animals as he chooses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the Emperor has tarried there, enjoying his
sport, as I have related, from March to the middle of May, he
moves with all his people, and returns straight to his capital
city of Cambaluc (which is also the capital city of Cathay, as
you have been told), but all the while continuing to take his
diversion in hunting and hawking as he travels.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We pass on to Marco Polo&rsquo;s description of Tibet, <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>which at one
time was considered a part of the empire of the Mongol
Khans.&nbsp; Its civil administration is ascribed to Kublai
Khan:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this region you find quantities of bamboos, full
three palms in girth, and fifteen paces in length, with an
interval of about three palms between the joints.&nbsp; And let
me tell you that merchants and other travellers through that
country are wont at nightfall to gather these canes and make
fires of them; for as they burn they make such loud reports, that
the lions and bears and other wild beasts are greatly frightened,
and make off as fast as possible; in fact, nothing will induce
them to come near a fire of that kind. <a
name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a>&nbsp; So, you see, the travellers make
these fires to protect themselves and their cattle from the wild
beasts, which have so greatly multiplied since the devastation of
the country.&nbsp; And it is this multiplication of the wild
beasts that prevents the country from being reoccupied.&nbsp; In
fact, but for the help of these bamboos, which make such a noise
in burning that the beasts are terrified and kept at a distance,
no one would be able even to travel through the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you how it is that the canes make such a
noise.&nbsp; The people cut the green canes, of which there are
vast numbers, and set fire to a heap of them at once.&nbsp; After
they have been burning awhile they burst asunder, and this makes
such a loud report, that you might hear it ten miles off.&nbsp;
In fact, <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>a
person unused to this noise, hearing it unexpectedly, might
easily go into a swoon or die of fright.&nbsp; But those
accustomed to it care nothing about it.&nbsp; Hence those who are
not used stuff their ears well with cotton, and wrap up their
heads and faces with all the clothes they can muster; and so they
get along until they have become used to the sound.&nbsp; It is
just the same with horses.&nbsp; Those unused to these noises are
so terrified that they break away from their halters and
heel-ropes, and many a man has lost his beasts in this way.&nbsp;
So all who do not wish to lose their horses are careful to tie
all four legs, and peg the ropes down strongly, and wrap the
heads and eyes and ears of the animals closely, and so they save
them.&nbsp; But horses also, when they have heard the noise
several times, cease to mind it.&nbsp; I tell you the truth,
however, when I say that the first time you hear it nothing can
be more alarming.&nbsp; And yet, in spite of all, the lions,
bears, and other wild beasts will sometimes come and do great
mischief; for in those parts they are very numerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ride for twenty days without finding any inhabited
spot, so that travellers are obliged to carry all their
provisions with them, and are constantly falling in with those
wild beasts which are so numerous and so dangerous.&nbsp; After
that you come at length to a tract where there are very many
towns and villages. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people are idolaters and an evil generation,
holding it no sin to rob and maltreat; in fact, they are the
greatest brigands on earth.&nbsp; They live by the chase, as well
as on their cattle and the fruits of the earth.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>&ldquo;I should tell you also that in this country are
many of the animals that produce musk, which are called in the
Tartar language <i>Gudderi</i>.&nbsp; These robbers have great
numbers of large and fierce dogs, which are of much service in
catching the musk-beasts, and so they procure an abundance of
musk.&nbsp; They have none of the Great Khan&rsquo;s paper money,
but use salt instead of money.&nbsp; They are very poorly clad,
for their clothes are only of the skins of beasts, and canvas,
and buckram.&nbsp; They have a language of their own, and are
called <i>Tebit</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Speaking of the people who dwell in the provinces to the
north-west of China, Marco Polo relates the following curious
custom:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When any one is ill, they send for the devil-conjurors,
who are the keepers of their idols.&nbsp; When these are come,
the sick man tells what ails him, and then the conjurors
incontinently begin playing on their instruments, and singing,
and dancing; and the conjurors dance to such a pitch, that at
last one of them will fall to the ground lifeless, like a dead
man.&nbsp; And then the devil entereth into his body.&nbsp; And
when his comrades see him in this plight, they begin to put
questions to him about the sick man&rsquo;s ailment.&nbsp; And he
will reply, &lsquo;Such or such a spirit hath been meddling with
the man, for that he hath angered it and done it some
despite.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then they say, &lsquo;We pray thee to
pardon him, and to take of his blood or of his goods what thou
wilt in consideration of thus restoring him to
health.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when they have so prayed, the malignant
spirit that is in the body of the prostrate man will, perhaps,
answer, &lsquo;The sick <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>man hath also done great despite unto
such another spirit, and that one is so ill-disposed that it will
not pardon him on any account.&rsquo;&nbsp; This, at least, is
the answer they get if the patient be like to die.&nbsp; But if
he is to get better, the answer will be that they are to bring
two sheep, or maybe three; and to brew ten or twelve jars of
drink, very costly and abundantly spiced.&nbsp; Moreover, it will
be announced that the sheep must be all black-faced, or of some
other particular colour, as it may happen; and then all these
things are to be offered in sacrifice to such and such a spirit
whose name is given.&nbsp; And they are to bring so many
conjurors, and so many ladies, and the business is to be done
with a great singing of lauds, and with many lights and store of
good perfumes.&nbsp; That is the sort of answer they get if the
patient is to get well.&nbsp; And then the kinsfolk of the sick
man go and procure all that has been commanded, and do as has
been bidden, and the conjuror springs to his feet again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they fetch the sheep of the prescribed colour, and
slaughter them, and sprinkle the blood over such places as have
been enjoined, in honour and propitiation.&nbsp; And the
conjurors come, and the ladies, in the number that was ordered,
and when all are assembled and everything is ready, they begin to
dance and play and sing in honour of the spirit.&nbsp; And they
take flesh-broth, and drink, and lign-aloes, and a great number
of lights, and go about hither and thither, scattering the broth
and the drink, and the meat also.&nbsp; And when they have done
this for a while, one of the conjurors will again fall flat, and
wallow there foaming at the mouth, and then the <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>others will
ask if he have yet pardoned the sick man.&nbsp; And sometimes he
will answer &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and sometimes he will answer
&lsquo;No.&rsquo;&nbsp; And if the answer be &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
they are told that something or other has to be done all over
again, and then he will be pardoned; so this they do.&nbsp; And
when all that the spirit has commanded has been done with great
ceremony, then it will be announced that the man is pardoned, and
will be speedily cured.&nbsp; So when they at length receive this
reply, they announce that it is all made up with the spirit, and
that he is propitiated, and they fall to eating and drinking with
great joy and mirth, and he who had been lying lifeless on the
ground gets up and takes his share.&nbsp; So when they have all
eaten and drunken, every man departs home.&nbsp; And presently
the sick man gets sound and well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[Sir A. Phayre testifies that this account of the exorcism of
evil spirits in cases of obstinate illness tallies exactly with
what he himself has seen in similar cases among the Burmese; and,
in truth, the practice extends widely among the non-Aryan
races.&nbsp; Bishop Caldwell furnishes the following description
of &ldquo;devil-dancing&rdquo; as it still exists among the
Shanars of Tinnevelly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the preparations are completed and the devil-dance
is about to commence, the music is at first comparatively slow;
the dancer seems impassive and sullen, and he either stands still
or moves about in gloomy silence.&nbsp; Gradually, as the music
becomes quicker and louder, his excitement begins to rise.&nbsp;
Sometimes, to help him to work himself up into a frenzy, he uses
medicated draughts, cuts and lacerates <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>himself till the blood flows, lashes
himself with a huge whip, presses a burning torch to his breast,
drinks the blood which flows from his own wounds, or drains the
blood of the sacrifice, putting the throat of the decapitated
goat to his mouth.&nbsp; Then, as if he had acquired new life, he
begins to brandish his staff of bells, and to dance with a quick,
but wild, unsteady step.&nbsp; Suddenly the afflatus descends;
there is no mistaking that glare, or those frantic leaps.&nbsp;
He snorts, he stares, he gyrates.&nbsp; The demon has now taken
bodily possession of him; and though he retains the power of
utterance and motion, both are under the demon&rsquo;s control,
and his separate consciousness is in abeyance.&nbsp; The
bystanders signalize the event by raising a long shout, attended
with a peculiar vibratory noise, caused by the motion of the hand
and tongue, or the tongue alone.&nbsp; The devil-dancer is now
worshipped as a present deity, and every bystander consults him
respecting his diseases, his wants, the welfare of his absent
relatives, the offerings to be made for the accomplishment of his
wishes, and, in short, everything for which superhuman knowledge
is supposed to be available.&rdquo;]</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; says Marco Polo, in concluding his
wonderful narrative,&mdash;&ldquo;and now ye have heard all that
we can tell you about the Tartars and the Saracens and their
customs, and likewise about the other countries of the world, so
far as our researches and information extend.&nbsp; Only we have
said nothing whatever about the Greater Sea [the Mediterranean],
and the provinces that lie round it, although we know it
thoroughly.&nbsp; But it seems to me a needless <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>and endless
task to speak about places which are visited by people every
day.&nbsp; For there are so many who sail all about that sea
constantly, Venetians, and Genoese, and Pisans, and many others,
that everybody knows all about it, and that is the reason that I
pass it over and say nothing of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the manner in which we took our departure from the
Court of the Great Khan you have already heard, and we have
related the fortunate chance that led to it.&nbsp; And you may be
sure that, but for that fortunate chance, we should never have
got away, in spite of all our trouble, and never have returned to
our country again.&nbsp; But I believe it was God&rsquo;s
pleasure we should return, in order that people might learn about
the things the world contains.&nbsp; For according to what has
been said in the introduction at the beginning of the book, there
never was man, be he Christian or Saracen or Tartar or heathen,
who ever travelled over so much of the world as did that noble
and illustrious citizen of the city of Venice, Messer Marco, the
son of Messer Nicolo Polo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks be to God!&nbsp; Amen!&nbsp; Amen!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We incline to believe, out of consideration for the modesty of
&ldquo;Messer Marco, the son of Messer Nicolo Polo,&rdquo; that
he finished his narrative at the word &ldquo;contains,&rdquo; and
that the last sentence was added by his amanuensis.&nbsp; Yet the
assertion it contains does not go beyond the truth.&nbsp; Of all
the medi&aelig;val travellers it may be repeated that Marco Polo
is the first and foremost; and the world is indebted to him for a
vast amount of valuable information, which, but for his industry,
his perseverance, and his intelligence, <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>would have
been wholly or partly lost.&nbsp; We owe to him a graphic and, as
it is now known to be, an accurate picture of the condition of
Asia in the thirteenth century; a picture full of lights and
shadows, but interesting and instructive in every detail.</p>

GEORGE F. RUXTON,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND HIS ADVENTURES IN MEXICO AND
THE</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">ROCKY MOUNTAINS.</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center">A.D. 1847.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Ruxton&rsquo;s</span> sweeping
condemnation of the Mexicans is, unfortunately, confirmed by most
reputable authorities, or we might hesitate to reproduce it
here.&nbsp; &ldquo;From south to north,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I
traversed the whole of the Republic of Mexico, a distance of
nearly ten thousand miles, and was thrown amongst the people of
every rank, class, and station; and I regret to have to say that
I cannot remember to have observed one single commendable trait
in the character of the Mexican; always excepting from this
sweeping clause the women of the country, who, for kindness of
heart and many sterling qualities, are an ornament to their sex,
and to any nation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever may be affirmed to the
discredit of the people, it cannot be doubted that they inhabit a
country which was at one time the seat of a remarkable
civilization, which presents to the traveller a succession of
remarkable and frequently romantic scenery, and a wonderful
variety and luxuriance of vegetation.</p>
<p>From the southern frontier of the United States <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>it stretches
down to the isthmus which connects the northern and southern
mainlands of the great American continent.&nbsp; On the west its
shores are washed by the waters of the Pacific; on the east, by
those of the Mexican Gulf and Caribbean Sea.&nbsp; Roughly
speaking, its area is about 850,000 square miles; its population
may number ten souls to a square mile.&nbsp; Its form of
government is pseudo-republican; and for administrative purposes
it is divided into twenty-five provinces.&nbsp; Its capital,
Mexico, has 200,000 inhabitants: its only other important towns
are Puebla, 75,000 inhabitants; Guadalajara, 65,000; Guanajuata,
50,000; and San Luis and Merida, about 45,000 each.</p>
<p>A glance at the map will show you that Mexico consists in the
main of an elevated table-land, which in the south rises up into
the Cordilleras of Central America, and on the east and west
descends, by more or less gradual terraces, to the
sea-coast.&nbsp; Owing to its geographical position, this
table-land enjoys the profuseness and beauty of a tropical
vegetation; on the other hand, its climate is so tempered by its
various elevations, which lie between 5000 and 9000 feet, that it
has been found possible to naturalize the European fauna and
flora.&nbsp; A remarkable geological feature is the volcanic belt
or chain that runs from ocean to ocean between the parallels of
18&deg; 15&prime; and 19&deg; 30&prime; north latitude, and is
marked by several active as well as extinct volcanoes.&nbsp;
Among them may be named Orizaba, Cittalapetl (&ldquo;The Mountain
of the Star&rdquo;), Popocatapetl (&ldquo;The Smoking
Mountain&rdquo;), 17,884 feet, Istaccihuatl (&ldquo;The White
Woman&rdquo;), and Toluca.&nbsp; Most of the mountain chains that
break up <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>the table-land are of comparatively low altitude; the
principal is the Sierra Madre, or Tepe Serene.&nbsp; The two
chief streams are the Rio Santiago and the Rio Grande del
Norte.</p>
<p>In company with a young Spaniard who was travelling as far as
Durango, Mr. Ruxton quitted Mexico one fine day in September,
1847, bent on crossing the country to the United States.&nbsp; He
passed at first through a mountainous district, covered with
dwarf oak and ilex; afterwards he entered upon a tract of open
undulating downs, dotted with thickets.&nbsp; Villages were few
and far between, and when found, not very attractive, consisting
only of a dozen huts built of adobes, or sun-dried bricks.&nbsp;
Crossing a rocky sierra, he came to the town of San Juan del Rio;
its one-storied houses of stone, whitewashed, with barred
windows, looking out upon a fair expanse of vineyard and
garden.&nbsp; Forty miles beyond lay Queretaro; a large and
well-built town of 40,000 inhabitants, surrounded by gardens and
orchards.&nbsp; Its chief trade is the manufacture of
cigars.&nbsp; These, as made at Queretaro, are of a peculiar
shape, about three inches long, square at both ends, and
exceedingly pungent in flavour.&nbsp; Excellent pulque is another
of its products.&nbsp; Pulque, the national liquor of Mexico, is
made from the saccharine juice of the American aloe, which
attains maturity at the age of eight or fourteen years, and then
flowers.&nbsp; Only while it is flowering may the juice be
collected.&nbsp; The central stem which encloses the coming
flower is cut off near the bottom, and a basin or hollow exposed,
over which the surrounding leaves are closely gathered and
fastened.&nbsp; The juice distils into the reservoir thus <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>provided, and
is removed three or four times during the twenty-four hours, by
means of a syphon made of a species of gourd called
acojote.&nbsp; One end is placed in the liquor, the other in the
mouth of the operator, who by suction draws up the sweet fluid
into the pipe, and forces it out into a bowl.&nbsp; Afterwards it
receives the addition of a little old pulque, and is allowed to
ferment for two or three days in earthen jars.&nbsp; When fresh,
pulque, according to Mr. Ruxton, is brisk and sparkling, and the
most cooling, refreshing, and delectable drink ever invented for
mortals when athirst.&nbsp; The Mexicans call it &ldquo;vino
divino;&rdquo; but, admirable as may be its qualities, it needs
to be very temperately used.</p>
<p>Between Queretaro and Celaya the traveller gradually descends
from the table-lands, and the air comes upon him with a warm
tropical breath.&nbsp; Nopalos, or prickly-pears, line the road;
the Indians collect the fruit&mdash;which is savoury and
invigorating&mdash;with a forked stick.&nbsp; At Silao striking
evidence of the geniality of the climate is supplied by the
variety of fruit exposed for sale: oranges, lemons, grapes,
chirimoyas, batatas, platanos, plantains, cumotes, grenadillas,
mamayos, tunas, pears, and apples&mdash;a list which would have
delighted Keats&rsquo;s Porphyro when he was preparing a
refection for his lady-love Madeline.&nbsp; But if fruit be
abundant, so are beggars and thieves; and Silao is not a
comfortable place to live in!&nbsp; Mexico, according to its
climatic conditions, is divided into three great
divisions&mdash;the <i>Tierras Frias</i>, or Cold lands; the
<i>Tierras Templadas</i>, or Temperate lands; and the <i>Tierras
Calientes</i>, or Hot lands.&nbsp; From Celaya our travellers
stooped down rapidly into the <i>Tierra Caliente</i>, and the <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>increased
temperature was every day more perceptibly felt.&nbsp; Jalisco,
the most important town on their route, is situated on the
western declivity of Anahuac, a Cordillera which unites the Andes
of South and Central America with the great North American chain
of the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; Mr. Ruxton describes the table-land
on the western ridge of the Cordillera as blessed with a fertile
soil and a temperate climate.&nbsp; It is studded with the
populous towns of Silao, Leon, Lagos, and Aguas Calientes.&nbsp;
The central portion, of a lower elevation and consequently higher
temperature, produces cotton, cochineal, vanilla, as well as
every variety of cereal produce.&nbsp; While the littoral, or
coast region, teems with fertility, and lies in the shadow of
immense forests, unfortunately it is cursed by the ever-prevalent
vomito, or yellow fever, and its climate is scarcely less fatal
to its inhabitants than to strangers.</p>
<p>At La Villa de Leon, a town celebrated for robbers and
murderers, Mr. Ruxton met with an adventure.&nbsp; About nine
o&rsquo;clock in the evening he was returning from the plaza,
which with its great lighted fires, the stalls of the
market-people, the strange garb of the peasantry, and the
snow-white sarapos, or cloaks, of the idlers of the town,
presented a stirring aspect, when, striking into a dark and
narrow street, a group of vagabonds, at the door of a pulque
shop, detected that he was a stranger, and, mistaking his
nationality, yelled at him: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s kill him, the
Texan!&rdquo;&nbsp; Having no weapon but a bowie-knife, and not
desiring an encounter with such overwhelming numbers, he turned
off into another street; but the rascals followed him, renewing
their wild cries.&nbsp; <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Happily, a dark doorway invited him
to seek its shelter, and while crouching in its obscurity, he
could see them rush by, knives in hand.&nbsp; When he thought
they had all passed, he stepped forth, to find himself confronted
by three wretches who brought up the rear, and who, brandishing
their knives and rushing headlong at him, cried, &ldquo;Here he
is, here he is; kill him!&rdquo;&nbsp; As the foremost rushed at
him with uplifted blade, he swiftly stepped aside, and at the
same moment thrust at him with his bowie.&nbsp; The robber fell
on his knees with a cry of &ldquo;Me ha matado!&rdquo; (&ldquo;He
has killed me!&rdquo;), and fell on his face.&nbsp; One of his
companions hastened to his assistance; the other dashed upon Mr.
Ruxton, but, confused by his calm attitude of preparation, fell
back a few paces, and finally slunk away.&nbsp; Mr. Ruxton
returned at once to his quarters, ordered out the horses, and in
a few minutes was on his road.</p>
<p>By way of Aguas Calientes, a very pretty town, and Zacatecas,
a populous mining town, he proceeded towards the Hacienda (or
farm) of San Nicolas, with the view of traversing that singular
volcanic region, the <i>Mal Pais</i>.&nbsp; Down to a
comparatively recent period, it would seem to have been the
theatre of plutonic phenomena of an extraordinary
character.&nbsp; The convexity of the district enables the
traveller to judge very readily of the extent of the convulsion,
which has spread to a distance of twelve or fourteen miles from
the central crater.&nbsp; The said crater measures about fifteen
hundred feet in circumference, and its sides are covered with
dwarf oaks, mezquito, and cocoa trees, which find a rich
nourishment in the chinks and crevices of the lava.&nbsp; At the
bottom <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>stagnate the green and slimy waters of a small lake,
which is fringed with rank shrubs and cacti, growing among huge
blocks of lava and scori&aelig;.&nbsp; Not a breath of air
disturbs its inky surface, save when a huge water-snake undulates
across it, or a duck and her progeny swim out from their covert
among the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I led my horse,&rdquo; says Mr. Ruxton, &ldquo;down to
the edge of the water, but he refused to drink the slimy liquid,
in which frogs, efts, and reptiles of every kind were darting and
diving.&nbsp; Many new and curious water-plants floated near the
margin, and one, lotus-leaved, with small delicate tendrils,
formed a kind of network on the water, with a superb crimson
flower, which exhibited a beautiful contrast with the inky
blackness of the pool.&nbsp; His Mexicans, as they passed this
spot, crossed themselves reverently, and muttered an <i>Ave
Maria</i>; for in the lonely regions of the Mal Pais, the
superstitious Indian believes that demons and gnomes and spirits
of evil persons have their dwelling-places, whence they not
unfrequently pounce upon the solitary traveller, to carry him
into the cavernous bowels of the earth.&nbsp; The arched roof of
the supposed prison-house resounding to the tread of their horses
as they pass the dreaded spot, they feel a sudden dread, and,
with rapidly muttered prayers, they handle their amulets and
charms to drive away the treacherous bogies who invisibly beset
the path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the Mal Pais Mr. Ruxton travelled onward to the rancho of
La Punta, a famous cattle-breeding station.</p>
<p>In the preceding autumn it had been harried by a party of
Comanche Indians, who, one day, without <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>warning, rode
across the sierra and swooped down upon it, killing, as they
passed, the peones, or labourers, whom they found at work in the
road.&nbsp; On their appearance the men made no attempt to defend
the rancho, but fled at full speed, abandoning the women and
children to their terrible fate.&nbsp; Some were carried away
captives; some pierced with arrows and lances, and left for dead;
others made the victims of unspeakable outrages.&nbsp; The
ranchero&rsquo;s wife, with her two adult daughters and several
younger children, fled from the rancho at the first alarm, to
conceal themselves under a wooden bridge, which crossed a
neighbouring stream.&nbsp; For several hours they escaped
detection; but at last some Indians drew near their hiding-place,
and a young chief took his station on the bridge to issue his
commands.&nbsp; With keen eyes he examined the spot, and
discovered the terror-stricken fugitives; but he pretended not to
have seen them, playing with them as a cat might with a
mouse.&nbsp; He hoped, he was heard to say, that he should find
out where the women were concealed, for he wanted a Mexican wife
and a handful of scalps.&nbsp; Then he leaped from the bridge,
and thrust his lance under it with a yell of exultation; the
point pierced the woman&rsquo;s arm, and she shrieked
aloud.&nbsp; She and her children were forthwith drawn from their
retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, alas, what a moment was that!&rdquo; said the
poor woman, as she told her painful story.&nbsp; The savages
brandished their tomahawks around her children, and she thought
that the last farewell had been taken.&nbsp; They behaved,
however, with unusual clemency; the captives were released, and
allowed to <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>return to their home&mdash;to find it a wreck, and the
ground strewn with the dead bodies of their kinsmen and
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay de mi!&rdquo; (&ldquo;Woe is me!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>While at La Punta, our traveller was witness of the Mexican
sport of the &ldquo;Col&eacute;a de toros&rdquo; (or
&ldquo;bull-tailing&rdquo;), for the enjoyment of which two or
three hundred rancheros had assembled from the neighbouring
plantations.</p>
<p>A hundred bulls were shut up in a large corral, or enclosure,
at one end of which had been erected a building for the
convenience of the lady spectators.&nbsp; The horsemen, brave in
their picturesque Mexican costume, were grouped around the
corral, examining the animals as they were driven to and fro in
order to increase their excitement, while the ranchero himself,
and his sons, brandishing long lances, were busily engaged in
forcing the wilder and more active bulls into a second
enclosure.&nbsp; When this had been effected, the entrance was
thrown open, and out dashed, with glaring eyes, tossing head, and
lashing tail, a fine bull, to gallop at his topmost speed over
the grassy plain before him, followed by the whole crowd of
shouting, yelling horsemen, each of whom endeavoured to outstrip
the other, and overtake the flying animal.&nbsp; At first they
all kept close together, riding very equally, and preserving
excellent order, but very soon superior skill or strength or
daring began to tell, and in front of the main body shot forth a
few of the cavaliers.&nbsp; Heading them all, in swift pursuit of
the rolling cloud of dust which indicated the bull&rsquo;s track,
rode the son of the ranchero, a boy about twelve years old; and
as he swayed this way and that when <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the bull doubled, the women made the
air ring with their shrill vivas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Viva, Pepito!
viva!&rdquo; cried his mother; and, dashing his spurs into his
horse&rsquo;s streaming flanks, the brave lad ran the race.&nbsp;
But before long the others came up with stealthy strides; soon
they were abreast of him.&nbsp; The pace quickened; the horses
themselves seemed to share the excitement; the men shouted, the
women screamed; each urged on her
favourite&mdash;&ldquo;Alza!&mdash;Bernardo!&mdash;Por mi amor,
Juan Maria!&mdash;Viva, Pepitito!&rdquo;&nbsp; A stalwart
Mexican, mounted on a fine roan, eventually took the lead, and
every moment increased the distance between himself and his
competitors.&nbsp; But Pepito&rsquo;s quick eyes detected a
sudden movement of the bull, and saw that, concealed by the dust,
he had wheeled off at a sharp angle from his former course.&nbsp;
In an instant Pepe did the same, and dashed in front of him, amid
a fresh outburst of cheers and vivas.&nbsp; Getting on the
bull&rsquo;s left quarter, he stooped down to seize his tail, and
secure it under his right leg, so as to bring him to the
ground.&nbsp; But for a man&oelig;uvre which requires great
muscular power, Pepe&rsquo;s strength was not equal to his
spirit, and, in attempting it, he was dragged from his saddle,
and thrown to the ground, senseless.&nbsp; Several horsemen had
by this time come up, and the bold rider of the roan galloping
ahead, threw his right leg over the bull&rsquo;s tail, and
turning his horse sharply outwards, upset the brute in the midst
of his fiery charge, rolling him over and over in the dust.</p>
<p>Another bull was then let loose, and the wild ride
recommenced; nor, until the corral was empty, and every horse and
horseman completely spent, did the game cease.&nbsp; It is a rude
game, though full of <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>excitement; a rude game, and,
perhaps, a cruel one; but we must not be harsh in our judgment,
remembering that our English sports and pastimes have not always
been exempt from a taint of ferocity.</p>
<p>A less manly and much more cruel equestrian game is called
&ldquo;el Gallo&rdquo; (&ldquo;the Cock)&rdquo;.&nbsp; Poor
chanticleer is tied by the leg to a post driven into the ground,
or to a tree, his head and neck being well greased.&nbsp; At a
given signal the horsemen start all together, and he who first
reaches the bird, and seizing it by its neck, releases it from
the fastenings, carries off the prize.&nbsp; The well-greased
neck generally eludes the eager fingers of him who first clutches
it; but whoever gets hold of the prize is immediately pursued by
the rest, intent upon depriving him of it.&nbsp; In the
<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> the unfortunate rooster is literally
torn to pieces, which the successful horsemen present as <i>gages
d&rsquo;amour</i> to their lady-loves.</p>
<p>At Durango, the capital of Northern Mexico, popularly known as
&ldquo;the City of Scorpions,&rdquo; the traveller was shown a
large mass of malleable iron, which lies isolated in the centre
of the plain.&nbsp; It is supposed to be an aerolite, because
identical in physical character and composition with certain
aerolites which fell in some part of Hungary in 1751.&nbsp;
Durango is 650 miles from Mexico, and, according to Humboldt,
6845 feet above the sea.&nbsp; At the time of Mr. Ruxton&rsquo;s
visit, it was expecting an attack from the Comanche Indians, of
whose sanguinary ferocity he tells the following &ldquo;owre
true&rdquo; story:&mdash;</p>
<p>Half-way between Durango and Chihuahua, in the Rio Florido
valley, lived a family of hardy vaqueros, or cattle-herders, the
head of whom, a stalwart man <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>of sixty, rejoiced in the sobriquet
of El Coxo (&ldquo;The Cripple&rdquo;).&nbsp; He had eight sons,
bold, resolute, vigorous fellows, famous for their prowess in
horsemanship, their daring and skill at the &ldquo;colea&rdquo;
or &ldquo;el Gallo.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this goodly company,
reminding us of the Nortons in Wordsworth&rsquo;s &ldquo;White
Doe of Rylstone&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;None for beauty or for worth<br />
Like those eight sons&mdash;who, in a ring<br />
(Ripe men, or blooming in life&rsquo;s spring),<br />
Each with a lance, erect and tall,<br />
A falchion and a buckler small,<br />
Stood by their sire,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the handsomest and most skilful was, perhaps, the third, by
name Escamilla, &ldquo;a proper lad of twenty, five feet ten out
of his zapatos, straight as an organo, and lithesome as a
reed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having been educated at Queretaro, he was more
refined than his brothers, and had acquired a taste for dress,
which enabled him to set off his comeliness to the best
advantage, and made him the cynosure of &ldquo;the bright
eyes&rdquo; of all the neighbouring rancheras.&nbsp; Next to him
came Juan Maria, who was scarcely less skilful, and certainly not
less daring than his brother, and by good judges was reputed to
be even handsomer, that is, manlier and more robust, though
inferior in polish of manner and picturesqueness of
appearance.&nbsp; Until Escamilla&rsquo;s return from Queretaro,
he had always been victor at &ldquo;el Gallo&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;colea,&rdquo; and had laid his spoils at the feet of the
beauty of the valley, Isabel Mora, a charming black-eyed damsel
of sixteen, called from the hacienda where she resided, Isabel de
la Cadena.&nbsp; It was understood that she accepted them with
pleasure, and rewarded the suitor with her smiles.</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>But the
course of true love never does run smooth, and in this instance
it was fated to be interrupted by fraternal treachery.&nbsp;
Escamilla contrived to win the fickle beauty&rsquo;s affections
from his brother, who, however, instead of resenting the deceit,
magnanimously forgave it, and withdrew all pretensions to her
hand.&nbsp; Escamilla and Isabel were duly affianced, and a day
was fixed for their marriage, which was to take place at the
bride&rsquo;s hacienda; and in honour of the occasion a grand
&ldquo;funcion de toros&rdquo; was proclaimed, to which all the
neighbours (the nearest of whom, by the way, was forty miles
distant) were duly invited.</p>
<p>Two days before the appointed wedding-day, El Coxo and his
eight sons made their appearance, extorting an admiring murmur
from all beholders as, mounted on superb steeds, they rode gaily
into the hacienda.</p>
<p>On the following day, leaving Escamilla at home El Coxo and
the rest of his sons accompanied the master of the hacienda into
the plains, to assist him in the arduous work of driving in the
bulls required for the morrow&rsquo;s sport; while the other
rancheros were busy in constructing the large corral intended to
secure them.</p>
<p>Evening was drawing near; the sun dropped rapidly behind the
rugged crest of the sierra, investing each ridge and precipice
with a luminous glory of gold and purple; while the cold grey
shadow of the coming night was swiftly creeping over the plain
beneath.&nbsp; The cry of the cranes was heard in the silence,
as, wedge-shaped, like the Macedonian phalanx of old, they
pursued their aerial flight; the shrill pipe of the mother quail
summoned together her foraging progeny; the brown hare stole from
its covert and <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>prowled about in search of food; and the lowing cattle
assembled on the bank of the stream to quench their thirst before
they were driven to their stalls.&nbsp; The peones, or labourers
of the farm, with slow gait were returning from the scene of
their day&rsquo;s work; while at the doors of the cottages the
women, with naked arms, were pounding the tortillas on stone
slabs in preparation for the evening meal.&nbsp; Everything
indicated that the hours of labour had passed, and those of rest
and refreshment come.</p>
<p>Escamilla and Isabel were wandering among the hushed pastures,
where the last rays of the sun still lingered with a soft subdued
radiance, building those airy castles in the construction of
which happy youth is always so eager and so dexterous.&nbsp; In
the distance they saw a little cloud of dust rising from the
plain; in another direction they heard the shouts of the
returning cowherds, and the heavy hoofs of the bulls they were
driving towards the corral.&nbsp; In advance rode a single
horseman, swiftly making for the hacienda.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the cloud of dust rolled onwards rapidly, and out
of it emerged several cavaliers, who suddenly dashed towards the
two happy lovers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here come the
bull-fighters,&rdquo; exclaimed Isabel; and with natural modesty
she added, &ldquo;Let us return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they are my father and brothers,&rdquo;
answered Escamilla.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, look; there are eight of
them.&nbsp; Do you not see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ay, she <i>did</i> see, as her gaze rested on the group of
horsemen, who, thundering across the mead, were now within a few
yards of them.&nbsp; She <i>did</i> see, and the blood ran cold
in her veins, and her face turned white <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>with fear;
for they were Comanche Indians, naked to the waist, horrible in
their war-paint, and fierce with brandished spears.&nbsp;
Escamilla saw them, too, and shrieking, &ldquo;Los barbaros! los
barbaros!&rdquo; he fled with rapid foot, and, like a coward,
abandoned his affianced to her fate.</p>
<p>A horseman met him: it was Juan Maria, who, having lassoed a
little antelope on the plains, was riding in advance of his
company to present it to the fickle Isabel.&nbsp; Glancing
around, he saw her imminent danger; flung down the animal he was
carrying in his arms, dashed his spurs desperately into his
horse&rsquo;s sides, and hastened to her rescue.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Salva me, Juan Maria!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;salva
me!&rdquo; (&ldquo;save me&rdquo;).&nbsp; But the bloodthirsty
savages were before him.&nbsp; With a ferocious whoop, the
foremost plunged his spear into her heart, and in a moment her
scalp was hanging from his saddle-bow.&nbsp; He did not long
enjoy his triumph.&nbsp; A clatter of hoofs caused him to turn;
and, behold, Juan Maria, with lasso swinging round his head, and
his heart beating with the desire of vengeance, rode fiercely
towards the murderer, heedless of the storm of arrows that rained
upon him.&nbsp; The savage shrank from the encounter; but the
open coil of the lasso, whirling through the air, fell over his
head, and dragged him to the ground with a fatal crash.</p>
<p>The odds, however, were against Juan Maria, who, surrounded by
Indians, had no other weapon than a small machete, or rusty
sword.&nbsp; Bating not one jot of heart or hope, he rushed on
the nearest Indian, and dealt a blow at his head, which cleft it
open; the savage fell dead.&nbsp; Daunted by the Mexican&rsquo;s
surpassing <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>courage, the others kept at a distance, discharging
their swift arrows, and piercing him with many wounds.&nbsp;
Spurring his horse towards them, he fought on bravely, cheered by
the shouts of his father and brothers, who were galloping full
speed to his support.&nbsp; Before they could reach him, an
arrow, discharged at but a few paces&rsquo; distance, penetrated
his heart.&nbsp; He slipped heavily from his horse, and one of
the Comanches rode away in triumph, with the heroic
Mexican&rsquo;s scalp as a trophy.</p>
<p>At that moment the Indians were reinforced by some thirty or
forty of their tribe, and a desperate struggle ensued between
them and El Coxo and his sons.&nbsp; The latter, burning with
rage at the death of their brother, fought with such eager
courage, that, outnumbered as they were, they slew half a dozen
of the Comanches.&nbsp; It is probable, however, they would have
been overpowered but for the arrival of the rancheros, who,
coming up from the hacienda, put the Indians to flight.&nbsp; As
night had darkened in the sky, they did not pursue; but returned
to the hacienda with the dead bodies of Juan Maria and Isabel,
who were buried the next day, side by side, at the very hour that
had been fixed for the unfortunate Isabel&rsquo;s marriage.&nbsp;
As for Escamilla, ashamed of his cowardice, he was seen no more
in the valley of the Rio Florido, but settled at Queretaro, where
he afterwards married.</p>
<p>This tragedy occurred on the 11th of October, 1845.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>From Durango Mr. Ruxton proceeded westward for Chihuahua and
New Mexico.&nbsp; On the second day of his journey an unpleasant
incident very sternly convinced him of the treachery and
bloodthirstiness of <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>the lower Mexicans.&nbsp; He was riding slowly ahead of
his native attendant, whom he had hired at Durango, when the
sudden report of fire-arms, and the whiz of a bullet close to his
head, caused him to turn sharply round, and he beheld his amiable
mozo [young man], pistol in hand, some fifteen yards behind him,
looking guilty as well as foolish.&nbsp; Drawing a pistol from
his holsters, Mr. Ruxton rode up to him immediately, and was
about to blow out his brains, when his terror-stricken and
absurdly guilty-looking face turned his employer&rsquo;s wrath
into &ldquo;an immoderate fit of laughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amigo,&rdquo; said Mr. Ruxton, &ldquo;do you call this
being skilled, as you boasted, in the use of arms, to miss my
head at fifteen yards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, caballero, in the name of all the saints, I did not
fire at you, but at a duck which was flying over the road.&nbsp;
Your worship cannot believe I would do such a thing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now, the pistols which Mr. Ruxton had given him to carry were
secured in a pair of holsters tightly buckled and strapped round
his waist.&nbsp; To unbuckle them at any time was difficult; to
unbuckle them in time to get one out to fire at a flying duck,
was impossible.&nbsp; Mr. Ruxton knew that the duck was an
invention, and a clumsy one, and to prevent another treacherous
attack, took from the fellow everything in the shape of offensive
weapon, including even his knife.&nbsp; Then, after lecturing him
severely, he administered a sound thrashing with the buckle-end
of his surcingle, and promised him that, if he were suspected of
even dreaming of another attempt at murder, he would be pistolled
without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>After
narrowly escaping a collision with a party of Indians, Mr. Ruxton
reached a place called El Gallo, where he resided for a couple of
days in the house of a farmer.&nbsp; He tells us that in a rancho
the time is occupied as follows:&mdash;The females of the family
rise at daybreak, and prepare the chocolate, or alde, which is
eaten the first thing in the morning.&nbsp; About nine
o&rsquo;clock, breakfast is served, consisting of chile colorado,
frijoles (beans), and tortillas (omelettes).&nbsp; Dinner, which
takes place at noon, and supper at sunset, are both substantial
meals.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the men employ themselves in the fields
or attending to the animals; the women about the house, making
clothes, cleaning, cooking, washing.&nbsp; In the evening the
family shell corn, and chat; or a guitar is brought, and singing
and dancing are continued until it is time to retire.</p>
<p>Riding onward from El Gallo, Mr. Ruxton turned aside from the
regular route to kill an antelope and broil a collop for
breakfast.&nbsp; He was descending the sierra to quench his
thirst at a stream which flowed through a ca&ntilde;on, or deep
ravine, when a herd of antelopes passed him, and stopped to feed
on a grassy plateau near at hand.&nbsp; He started in
pursuit.&nbsp; As soon as he got within rifle-shot, he crept
between two rocks at the edge of the hollow, and raised his head
to reconnoitre, when he saw a sight which startled him, as the
footprint on the sand startled Robinson Crusoe.&nbsp; About two
hundred yards from the ca&ntilde;on, and scarcely twice that
distance from his place of concealment, eleven Comanches, duly
equipped for war, each with lance and bow and arrow, and the
chief with a rifle also, were riding along in Indian file.&nbsp;
They were naked to the waist, their buffalo robes being thrown
off their <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>shoulders, and lying on their hips and across the
saddle, which was a mere pad of buffalo-skin.&nbsp; Slowly they
drew towards the ca&ntilde;on, as if to cross it by a deer-path
near the spot where Mr. Ruxton lay concealed.&nbsp; The odds were
great; but he was advantageously posted, and he held in readiness
his rifle, a double-barrelled carbine, and a couple of
pistols.&nbsp; If he were attacked, he thought he could make a
good defence; but, if unobserved, he had nothing to gain by
attacking them.&nbsp; On they came, laughing and talking, and Mr.
Ruxton, raising his rifle and supporting it in the fork of a bush
which served as a screen, covered the chief with deadly
aim.&nbsp; On they came, but suddenly diverged from the deer-path
and struck across the plain, thereby saving the chief&rsquo;s
life, and probably Mr. Ruxton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; As soon as they had
disappeared, he recrossed the sierra, and returned for the night
to El Gallo.</p>
<p>The next stage from El Gallo was Mapimi, situated at the foot
of a range of mountains which teems with the precious
metals.&nbsp; There he got rid of his mozo, or native attendant,
and engaged in his place a little Irishman, who had been eighteen
years in Mexico, and had almost forgotten his own language.&nbsp;
He readily agreed to accompany him to Chihuahua, having no fear
of the Indians, though they infested the country through which
the travellers would have to pass.&nbsp; They reached Chihuahua,
however, without misadventure.&nbsp; Its territory is described
as a paradise for sportsmen.&nbsp; The common black or American
bear, and the formidable grizzly bear, inhabit the sierras and
mountains; and in the latter is found the carnero cimarron, or
big-horn sheep.&nbsp; <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Elk, black-tailed deer, cola-arieta
(a large species of the fallow deer), the common American red
deer, and antelope, are everywhere abundant.&nbsp; Of smaller
game the most numerous are peccaries, hares, and rabbits; and in
the streams the beavers still construct their dams.&nbsp; There
are two varieties of wolf&mdash;the white, or mountain wolf, and
the cayeute, or coyote, commonly called the prairie-dog.&nbsp; Of
birds the most common are the faisan (a species of pheasant),
snipe, plover, crane, and the quail, or rather a bird between a
partridge and a quail.</p>
<p>The entomologist would find much to interest him in the plains
of Chihuahua, and especially an insect which seems almost
peculiar to that part of Mexico.&nbsp; From four to six inches in
length, it has four long slender legs.&nbsp; Its body, to the
naked eye, seems nothing more than a blade of grass, and has no
apparent muscular action or vitality except in the two
antenn&aelig;, which are about half an inch long.&nbsp; It moves
very slowly upon its long legs, and altogether looks not unlike a
blade of grass carried by ants.&nbsp; The Mexicans assert that if
horse or mule swallow these zacateros (so called from
<i>zacato</i>, grass), it invariably dies; but the assertion may
well be doubted.&nbsp; The variety of spiders, bugs, and beetles
is endless, including the tarantula and the cocuyo, or
lantern-bug.&nbsp; Of reptiles the most common are the
rattlesnake and the copper-head: both are poisonous; and the
sting of the scorpion is fatal under some conditions.&nbsp; The
grotesque but harmless cameleon abounds in the plains.&nbsp; On
the American prairies it is known as the &ldquo;horned
frog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vegetation is very scanty in Chihuahua.&nbsp; The shrub that
covers its plains, the mezquit, is a species of acacia, growing
to a height of ten or twelve feet.&nbsp; <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>The seeds,
contained in a small pod, resemble those of the laburnum, and are
used by the Apache Indians to make a kind of bread, or cake,
which is not unpleasant to the taste.&nbsp; This constantly
recurring and ugly shrub, according to Mr. Ruxton, becomes quite
an eyesore to the traveller who crosses the mezquit-covered
plains.&nbsp; It is the only thing in the shape of a tree seen
for hundreds of miles, except here and there a solitary alamo or
willow, overhanging a spring, and invariably bestowing its name
on the rancho or hacienda which may generally be found in the
vicinity of water.&nbsp; Thus day after day the traveller passed
the ranchos of El Sauz, Los Sauzes, Los Sauzilles&mdash;the
willow, the willows, the little willows,&mdash;or El Alamo, Los
Alamitos&mdash;the poplar, the little poplars.&nbsp; The last is
the only timber found on the streams in northern Mexico, and on
the Del Norte and the Arkansas it grows to a great size.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Leaving Chihuahua, Mr. Ruxton set out for the capital of New
Mexico, escorted by three dragoons of the regiment of Vera Cruz,
and carrying despatches from the governor to the commander of the
American troops then posted on the frontier.&nbsp; At El Paso del
Norte he entered a valley of great fertility; but this delightful
change of scenery lasted only as far as San Diego, where begins
the dreaded and dreadful wilderness significantly known as the
<i>Jornada del Muerto</i>, or &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s
Journey.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only is it cursed by an absolute want
of water and pasture, but it is the favourite foraging-ground of
the Apache Indians, who are always on the alert to surprise the
unwary traveller, to plunder and kill him.&nbsp; There <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>is no
vegetation but artemisia (sago) and screw-wood (torscilla).&nbsp;
About half-way lies a hollow or depression called the <i>Laguna
del Muerto</i>, or &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s Lake,&rdquo; but this
is hard and dry except in the rainy season.&nbsp; Mr.
Ruxton&rsquo;s horses suffered considerably, but the &ldquo;Dead
Man&rsquo;s Journey&rdquo; of ninety-five or one hundred miles
was performed, nevertheless, without accident in twenty-four
hours.</p>
<p>At Fray Cristoval Mr. Ruxton came upon the river Del Norte,
and thence pushed along its banks to the ruins of Valverde,
where, encamped in the shade of noble trees, he found a trading
caravan and a United States surveying party, under the command of
a Lieutenant Abert.&nbsp; The traders&rsquo; waggons were drawn
up so as to form a corral, or square&mdash;a laager, as the Boers
of South Africa call it&mdash;constituting a truly formidable
encampment, which, lined with the fire of some hundred rifles,
could defy the attacks of Indians or Mexicans.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Scattered about,&rdquo; says Mr. Ruxton, &ldquo;were tents
and shanties of logs and branches of every conceivable form,
round which lounged wild-looking Missourians; some looking at the
camp-fires, some cleaning their rifles or firing at
targets&mdash;&lsquo;blazes&rsquo; cut in the trees&mdash;with a
bull&rsquo;s-eye made with wet powder on the white bark.&nbsp;
From morning till night the camp resounded with the popping of
rifles, firing at marks for prizes of tobacco, or at any living
creature which presented itself.&nbsp; The oxen, horses, and
mules were sent out at daylight to pasture on the grass of the
prairie, and at sunset made their appearance, driven in by the
Mexican herders, and were secured for the night in the
corrals.&nbsp; My own animals roamed at will, but every evening
came to <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>the river to drink, and made their way to my camp, where
they would frequently stay round the fire all night.&nbsp; They
never required herding, for they made their appearance as
regularly as the day closed, and would come to my whistle
whenever I required my hunting mule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ruxton remained several days at Valverde in order to
recruit his animals.&nbsp; He amused himself by hunting.&nbsp;
Deer and antelope were plentiful; so were turkeys, hares,
rabbits, and quail on the plain, geese and ducks in the river;
and he had even a shot&mdash;an unsuccessful one&mdash;at a
painter, or panther.&nbsp; In some men the love of sport amounts
to a passion, and in Mr. Ruxton it seems to have been equalled or
surpassed only by his love of adventure.&nbsp; But about the
middle of December the camp broke up, the traders departing for
Fray Cristoval; while Mr. Ruxton resumed his northward journey,
in company with Lieutenant Abert&rsquo;s party.&nbsp; Crossing
the Del Norte, he arrived at Socorro, the first settlement of New
Mexico upon this river.&nbsp; Here the houses are <i>not</i>
painted, but the women <i>are</i>; they stain their faces, from
forehead to chin, with the fire-red juice of the alegria, to
protect the skin from the effects of the sun.&nbsp; At Galisteo
he met with a typical Yankee, of the kind Sam Slick has made us
familiar with&mdash;a kind that is rapidly dying
out,&mdash;sharp, active, self-reliant; a cunning mixture of
inquisitiveness, shrewdness, and good nature.&nbsp; On reaching
Mr. Ruxton&rsquo;s encampment he unyoked his twelve oxen,
approached the camp-fire, and seated himself almost in the blaze,
stretching his long lean legs at the same time into the
ashes.&nbsp; Then he began: &ldquo;Sich a poor old country, I
say!&nbsp; Wall, <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>strangers, an ugly camp this, I swar; and what my cattle
ull do I don&rsquo;t know, for they have not eat since we put out
of Santa F&eacute;, and are very near give out, that&rsquo;s a
fact; and thar&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; here for &rsquo;em to eat,
surely.&nbsp; Wall, they must jist hold on till to-morrow, for I
have only got a pint of corn apiece for &rsquo;em tonight anyhow,
so there&rsquo;s no two ways about that.&nbsp; Strangers, I guess
now you&rsquo;ll have a skillet among ye; if yev a mind to trade,
I&rsquo;ll jist have it right off; anyhow, I&rsquo;ll jist borrow
it to-night to bake my bread, and, if you wish to trade, name
your price. . . .&nbsp; Sich a poor old country, say I!&nbsp;
Jist look at them oxen, wull ye!&mdash;they&rsquo;ve nigh upon
two hundred miles to go; for I&rsquo;m bound to catch up the
sogers afore they reach the Pass, and there&rsquo;s not a go in
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Ruxton, &ldquo;would it not
be as well for you to feed them at once and let them
rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, I guess if you&rsquo;ll some of you lend me a
hand, I&rsquo;ll fix &rsquo;em right off; tho&rsquo;, I tell you!
they&rsquo;ve give me a pretty lot of trouble, they have, I tell
you! but the critturs will have to eat, I
b&rsquo;lieve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aid asked for was given, and some corn added to the scanty
rations which he put before his wearied and hungry oxen.&nbsp;
When they had been fixed, the Yankee returned to the fire and
baked his cake, fried his bacon, and made his coffee, while his
tongue kept up an incessant clatter.&nbsp; He was all alone, with
a journey of two hundred miles before him, and his waggon and
twelve oxen to look after; his sole thought and object, however,
were dollars, dollars, dollars!&nbsp; He caught up every article
he saw lying about, wondered what it cost and what it was worth,
offered to trade for it, or for anything else which <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>anybody might
be disposed to offer, never waiting for an answer, but rattling
on, eating and drinking and talking without pause; until at last,
gathering himself up, he said, &ldquo;Wall, I guess I&rsquo;ll
turn into my waggon now, and some of you will, maybe, give a look
round at the cattle every now and then, and I&rsquo;ll thank
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; No sooner said than done.&nbsp; With a hop,
step, and a jump, he sprang into his waggon, and was snoring in a
couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Next morning, at daybreak, while he was still asleep, Mr.
Ruxton resumed his journey, and before evening entered Santa
F&eacute;, after a ride in all of nearly two thousand miles.</p>
<p>There was nothing in Santa F&eacute; to repay him for all he
had undergone in getting there.&nbsp; The houses were built of
sun-dried mud, and every other one was a grocery, that is, a gin
or whisky shop, where Mexicans and Americans were drinking
eagerly or playing mont&eacute;.&nbsp; The streets were filled
with brawlers, among whom Pueblo Indians and priests endeavoured
to make their way.&nbsp; Donkey-loads of hoja, or corn-shucks,
were hawked about for sale.&nbsp; It was noise everywhere; noise
and filth, dirt and drink.&nbsp; The town contains about 3500
inhabitants, and lies at the foot of a summit of the eastern
chain of the Rocky Mountains, about fourteen miles from the river
Del Norte.&nbsp; As for the province, it covers an area of 6000
square miles, with a population of 70,000, divided among the
Mexico-Spanish (descendants of the original settlers), the
Mestizos (or half-castes), and the Indian Manzos or Pueblos (the
aboriginal inhabitants).</p>
<p>Mr. Ruxton was so disgusted with Santa F&eacute;, that <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>in a very few
days he had packed his mules, taken his leave of its profanity,
drunkenness, and squalidness, and, through the valley of Taos,
continued his northward route.&nbsp; The landscape was now
ennobled by the majesty of the Rocky Mountains, with cool green
valleys and misty plains lying among them, through which the
river had hewn its way in deep rocky ca&ntilde;ons.&nbsp; The
scenery had assumed a new character of grandeur, and Mr. Ruxton
surveyed it with admiration.&nbsp; At the Rio Colorado he crossed
the United States frontier, and plunged into the wild expanse of
snow, with towering peaks rising on every side, that lay before
him; his object being to cross the Rocky Mountains by the trail
or track of the Ute Indians, and strike the river Arkansas near
its head-waters.&nbsp; The cold was intense, and when a cutting
wind swept over the bleak plains or roared through the wooded
valleys, the hardy traveller found scarcely endurable.</p>
<p>Stricken almost to the heart, he suffered the antelope that
bounded past&mdash;hunter as he was!&mdash;to go unscathed.&nbsp;
His hands, rigid as those of &ldquo;the Commandant&rdquo; in the
statue-scene of Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Don Giovanni,&rdquo;
dropped the reins of his horse, and allowed him to travel as he
pleased.&nbsp; The half-breed who attended him, wrapped himself
round in his blanket, and heaved a sigh at the thought of the
fine venison that was being lost.&nbsp; At length, a troop of
some three thousand swept almost over them, and Mr.
Ruxton&rsquo;s instincts as a sportsman prevailed over the
inertness and deadness induced by the icy air; he sprang from his
horse, knelt down, and sent a bullet right into the midst.&nbsp;
At the report two antelopes <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>leaped into the air, to fall
prostrate in the dust; one of them shot in the neck, through
which the ball had passed into the body of the other.&nbsp; While
he was cutting up the prize, half a dozen wolves howled around,
drawn to the spot by the scent of blood.&nbsp; A couple of these
creatures, tamed by hunger, gradually drew nearer, occasionally
crouching on their haunches, and licking their eager lips as if
already partaking of the banquet.&nbsp; Mr. Ruxton flung at them
a large piece of meat; whereupon the whole pack threw themselves
upon it, growling and fighting, and actually tearing each other
in the wild, fierce fray.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; says our
traveller, &ldquo;I might have approached near enough to have
seized one by the tail, so entirely regardless of my vicinity did
they appear.&nbsp; They were doubtless rendered more ravenous
than usual by the uncommon severity of the weather, and from the
fact of the antelope congregating in large bands, were unable to
prey upon these animals, which are their favourite food.&nbsp;
Although rarely attacking a man, yet in such seasons as the
present I have no doubt that they would not hesitate to charge
upon a solitary traveller in the night, particularly as in winter
they congregate in troops of from ten to fifty.&nbsp; They are so
abundant in the mountains, that the hunter takes no notice of
them, and seldom throws away upon the skulking beasts a charge of
powder and lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ruxton pitched his camp at Rib Creek one night; at La
Culebra, or Snake Creek, the next; at La Trinchera, or Bowl
Creek, on the third.&nbsp; The cold continued excessive.&nbsp;
The blast seemed to carry death upon its wings; snow and sleet
fell in heavy <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>showers; the streams were covered with a solid crust of
ice.&nbsp; But the worst part of the journey was through the
Vallerito, or Little Valley&mdash;the &ldquo;Wind-trap,&rdquo; as
the mountaineers expressively call it&mdash;a small circular
basin in the midst of rugged mountains, which receives the winds
through their deep gorges and down their precipitous sides, and
pens them up in its confined area to battle with one another, and
with the unfortunates who are forced to traverse it.&nbsp; How
they beat and rage and howl and roar!&nbsp; How they buffet the
traveller in the face, and clasp him round the body as if they
would strangle him!&nbsp; How they dash against the stumbling
mules, and whirl the thick snow about them, and plunge them into
dense deep drifts, where they lie half buried!&nbsp; This
&ldquo;Wind-trap&rdquo; is only four miles long; and yet Mr.
Ruxton was more than half a day in getting through it.</p>
<p>Once clear of it, he began the ascent of the mountain which
forms the watershed of the Del Norte and Arkansas rivers.&nbsp;
The view from the summit was as wild and drear as one of the
circles in Dante&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inferno.&rdquo;&nbsp; Looking
back, the traveller saw everywhere a dense white pall or shroud
of snow, which seemed to conceal but partially the rigid limbs of
the dead and frozen earth.&nbsp; In front of him stretched the
main chain of the Rocky Mountains, dominated by the lofty crest
of James&rsquo;s or Pike&rsquo;s Peak; to the south-east, large
against the sky, loomed the grim bulk of the two Cumbres
Espa&ntilde;olas.&nbsp; At his feet, a narrow valley, green with
dwarf oak and pine, was brightened by the glancing lights of a
little stream.&nbsp; Everywhere against the horizon rose rugged
summits and ridges, snow-clad and pine-clad, and partly <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>separated by
rocky gorges.&nbsp; To the eastward the mountain mass fell off
into detached spires and buttresses, and descended in broken
terraces to the vast prairies, which extended far beyond the
limit of vision, &ldquo;a sea of seeming barrenness, vast and
dismal.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the traveller gazed upon them, billows of
dust swept over the monotonous surface, impelled by a driving
hurricane.&nbsp; Soon the mad wind reached the mountain-top, and
splintered the tall pines, and roared and raved in its insatiable
fury, and filled the air with great whirls of snow, and heaped it
up in dazzling drifts against the trees.&nbsp; Its stern voice
made the silence and the solitude all the more palpable.&nbsp;
For not a sound of bird or beast was to be heard; nor was there
sign or token of human life.&nbsp; In such a scene man is made to
feel his own littleness.&nbsp; In the presence of the giant
forces of Nature he seems so mean and powerless that his heart
sinks within him, and his brain grows dizzy, until he remembers
that behind those forces is a Power, eternal and supreme&mdash;a
Power that seeks not to destroy, but to bless and comfort and
save.</p>
<p>With no little difficulty, Mr. Ruxton and his guide conveyed
their mules and horses down the steep eastern side of the
mountain into the valley beneath.&nbsp; Across Greenhorn Creek
they pushed forward to the banks of the San Carlos; and fourteen
miles beyond, they struck the Arkansas, a few hundred yards above
the mouth of Boiling Spring River.&nbsp; There he was hospitably
entertained in the &ldquo;lodge&rdquo; of a certain mountaineer
and ex-trapper, John Hawkins.</p>
<p>The home and haunt of the trapper is the vast region of forest
and prairie known as the Far West.&nbsp; <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>He extends
his operations from the Mississippi to the mouth of the western
Colorado, from the frozen wastes of the north to the Gila in
Mexico; making war against every animal whose skin or fur is of
any value, and exhibiting in its pursuit the highest powers of
endurance and tenacity, a reckless courage, and an inexhaustible
fertility of resource.&nbsp; On starting for a hunt, whether as
the &ldquo;hired hand&rdquo; of a fur company, or working on his
own account, he provides himself with two or three horses or
mules&mdash;one for saddle, the others for packs&mdash;and six
traps, which are carried in a leather bag called a
&ldquo;trap-sack.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a wallet of dressed
buffalo-skin, called a &ldquo;possible-sack,&rdquo; he carries
his ammunition, a few pounds of tobacco, and dressed deerskins
for mocassins and other articles.&nbsp; When hunting, he loads
his saddle mule with the &ldquo;possible&rdquo; and
&ldquo;trap-sack;&rdquo; the furs are packed on the baggage
mules.&nbsp; His costume is a hunting shirt of dressed buckskin,
ornamented with long fringes; and pantaloons of the same
material, but decorated with porcupine quills and long fringes
down the outside of the leg.&nbsp; His head bears a flexible felt
hat; his feet are protected by mocassins.&nbsp; Round his neck is
slung his pipe-holder, generally a love token, in the shape of a
heart, garnished with beads and porcupine quills.&nbsp; Over his
left shoulder and under his right arm hang his powder-horn and
bullet-pouch, in which are stored his balls, flint and steel, and
all kinds of &ldquo;odds and ends.&rdquo;&nbsp; A large
butcher-knife, in a sheath of buffalo-hide, is carried in a belt,
and fastened to it by a chain or guard of steel.&nbsp; A tomahawk
is also often added, and a long heavy rifle is necessarily
included in the equipment.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Thus
provided (we quote now from Mr. Ruxton), and having determined
the locality of his trapping-ground, he starts for the mountains,
sometimes with three or four companions, as soon as the worst of
the winter has passed.&nbsp; When he reaches his hunting-grounds,
he follows up the creeks and streams, vigilantly looking out for
&ldquo;sign.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he observes a cotton-wood tree lying
prone, he examines it to discover if its fall be the work of the
beaver; and, if so, whether &ldquo;thrown&rdquo; for the purpose
of food, or to dam the stream, and raise the water to a level
with its burrow.&nbsp; The track of the beaver on the mud or sand
under the bank is also examined; and if the &ldquo;sign&rdquo; be
fresh, he sets his trap in the run of the animal, hiding it under
water, and attaching it by a stout chain to a picket driven in
the bank, or to a bush or tree.&nbsp; A &ldquo;float-stick&rdquo;
is fastened to the trap by a cord a few feet long, which, if the
animal carry away the trap, floats on the water and indicates its
position.&nbsp; The trap is baited with the
&ldquo;medicine,&rdquo; an oily substance obtained from a gland
in the scrotum of the beaver.&nbsp; Into this is dipped a stick,
which is planted over the trap; and the beaver, attracted by the
smell, and wishing a close inspection, very foolishly puts his
leg into the trap, and falls a victim to his curiosity.</p>
<p>When &ldquo;a lodge&rdquo; is discovered, the trap is set at
the edge of the dam, at the point where the amphibious animals
pass from deep to shoal water, but always beneath the
surface.&nbsp; In early morning the hunter mounts his mule, and
examines his traps.&nbsp; The captured animals are skinned, and
the tails, a great dainty, carefully packed into camp.&nbsp; The
skin is then stretched over a hoop or framework of osier twigs,
<a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>and is
allowed to dry, the flesh and fatty substance being industriously
scraped or &ldquo;grained.&rdquo;&nbsp; When dry, it is folded
into a square sheet, with the fur turned inwards, and the bundle
of ten to twenty skins, well pressed and carefully corded, is
ready for exportation.</p>
<p>During the hunt, regardless of Indian vicinity, the fearless
trapper wanders far and near in search of
&ldquo;sign.&rdquo;&nbsp; His nerves must always be in a state of
tension; his energies must always rally at his call.&nbsp; His
eagle eye sweeps round the country, and in an instant detects any
unusual appearance.&nbsp; A turned leaf, a blade of grass pressed
down, the uneasiness of the wild animals, the flight of birds,
are all paragraphs to him, written in Nature&rsquo;s legible hand
and plainest language.&nbsp; The subtle savage summons his utmost
craft and cunning to gain an advantage over the wily white
woodman; but, along with the natural instinct of primitive man,
the white hunter has the advantages of the civilized mind, and,
thus provided, seldom fails to baffle, under equal advantages,
his Indian adversary.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>While hunting in the Arkansas valley, Mr. Ruxton met with many
exciting experiences; the most serious being that of a night in
the snow.&nbsp; Suspecting that some Indians had carried off his
mules, he seized his rifle, and went in search of them, and
coming upon what he supposed to be their track, followed it up
with heroic patience for ten miles.&nbsp; He then discovered that
he had made a mistake; retraced his steps to the camp, and, with
his friend, struck in another direction.&nbsp; This time he hit
on the right trail, and was well pleased to find that the animals
were not in Indian hands, as their ropes evidently still dragged
<a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>along the
ground.&nbsp; Carrying a lariat and saddle-blanket, so as to ride
back on the mules if they were caught, away went the two
dauntless hunters, nor did they stop to rest until
midnight.&nbsp; Then, in the shelter of a thicket and on the bank
of a stream, they kindled a fire, and thankfully lay down within
reach of its genial influence.&nbsp; Alas! a gale of wind at that
moment arose, and scattering the blazing brands to right and
left, soon ignited the dry grass and bushes; so that, to prevent
a general conflagration, they were compelled to extinguish their
fire.&nbsp; To prevent themselves from being frozen to death,
they started again in pursuit of the missing animals, following
the trail by moonlight across the bare cold prairies.&nbsp; Next
day their labours were rewarded by the recovery of the mules, and
Mr. Ruxton and his Irish companion began to think of
returning.&nbsp; The latter, by agreement, made at once for the
trapper&rsquo;s cabin; Ruxton, with the animals, turned off in
search of some provisions and packs that had been left in their
hunting encampment.&nbsp; Since morning the sky had gradually
clouded over, and towards sunset had blackened into a dense,
heavy, rolling darkness.&nbsp; The wind had gone down, and a
dead, unnatural calm, the sure precursor of a storm, reigned over
the face of nature.&nbsp; The coyote, mindful of the coming
disturbance, was trotting back to his burrow, and the raven, with
swift wings, laboured towards the shelter of the woods.</p>
<p>Lower and lower sank the clouds, until the very bases of the
mountains were hidden, and the firmament and the earth seemed
mingled together.&nbsp; Though neither branch nor spray was
stirred, the valley rang <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>with a hoarse murmur.&nbsp; Through
the gloom the leafless branches of the huge cotton-wood trees
protruded like the gaunt arms of fleshless phantoms.&nbsp; The
whole scene was eery and weird, impressing the mind with an
indefinable sense of awe, with an apprehension of approaching
disaster.&nbsp; The traveller turned his animals towards the
covert of the wood; and they, quivering with terror, were not
less eager than himself to gain it.&nbsp; Two-thirds of the
distance still lay before them, when the windows of heaven
opened, and the storm broke, and a tremendous roar filled the
valley, and thick showers of sleet descended, freezing as it
fell.&nbsp; The lonely traveller&rsquo;s hunting-shirt was soaked
through in a moment, and in another moment frozen hard.&nbsp; The
enormous hailstones, beating on his exposed head and
face&mdash;for the wind had carried away his cap&mdash;almost
stunned and blinded him.&nbsp; The mule he bestrode was suddenly
caparisoned with a sheet of ice.&nbsp; To ride was
impossible.&nbsp; He sprang to the ground, and wrapped himself in
the saddle-cloth.&nbsp; As the storm beat in front of them, the
animals wheeled away from the wood, turned their backs upon it,
and made for the open prairies; still, through the intense
darkness, whirled and buffeted in clouds of driving snow, Mr.
Ruxton steadfastly followed them.&nbsp; His sufferings were
indescribable; but he persevered.&nbsp; The wind chilled his
blood; the sleet wounded his eyes; with difficulty his weary feet
toiled through the gathering snow, which was soon two feet in
depth; but he persevered.&nbsp; This quality of tenaciousness,
without which no man can become a successful traveller, any more
than he can become a successful musician, painter, sculptor,
engineer, Mr. Ruxton possessed in <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>an eminent degree.&nbsp; He pursued
the frightened animals across the darkening prairie, until,
suddenly, on the leeward side of a tuft of bushes, they stood
still.&nbsp; Some vain attempts he made to turn them towards the
wood; they would not move; so that at length, completely
exhausted, and seeing before him nothing but inevitable death, he
sank down behind them in the deep snow, covering his head with
his blanket&mdash;far away from human habitation,&mdash;far away
from all help, but that of God!</p>
<p>Ah, what a night was that!&nbsp; How the wind roared over the
frozen plain!&nbsp; How the snow rolled before it in dense huge
billows, that took in the darkness a sombre greyish colour!&nbsp;
What horrible sounds surged upon the ear and brain of the
benumbed watcher, as, with his head on his knees, pressed down by
the snow as by a leaden weight, with the chilled blood scarcely
flowing in his veins, and an icy torpor threatening to arrest the
very motion of his heart, he struggled against the temptation of
a slumber from which he knew that he should wake no more on
earth!&nbsp; Once yield to that fatal sleep, and farewell to
life!&nbsp; Yet how he longed to close his aching eyes, to rest
his weary brain, to cease from the tumult of thought and feeling
that confused and exhausted him!&nbsp; Every now and then the
mules would groan heavily, and fall upon the snow, and again
struggle to their legs.&nbsp; Every now and then the yell of
famished wolves arose in the pauses of the storm.&nbsp; So passed
the night, or, rather, to the hunter it seemed as if it were
prolonging itself into day; each second was lengthened into a
minute, each minute into an hour.&nbsp; At last, by keeping his
hands buried in the bosom of his <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>hunting-shirt, he so far restored
their natural warmth, that he was able to strike a match and set
light to his pipe, a large one made of cotton-wood bark, that
chanced, by great good fortune, to be filled with tobacco to the
brim.&nbsp; This he smoked with intense delight, and no doubt the
stimulus it afforded saved his life.</p>
<p>He was sinking, however, into a dreamy drowsiness, when he was
roused by a movement among the mules, which cheered him by
proving that they were still alive.&nbsp; With some difficulty he
lifted his head to get a look at the weather, but all was pitch
dark.&nbsp; Was it still night?&nbsp; Suddenly he remembered that
he was buried deep in snow, and thrusting his arm above him, he
worked out a hole, through which he could see the sheen of stars
and the glimmer of blue sky.&nbsp; After one or two efforts, he
contrived to stand on his feet, and then he discovered that
morning was dawning slowly in the east, whore the horizon was
clear of clouds.&nbsp; By dint of constant exertion he regained
the use of his limbs, and, springing on his horse, drove the
mules before him at full speed across the prairie, and through
the valley, until he reached the Arkansas, where he was welcomed
as one who had risen from the grave.&nbsp; It took him two days,
however, to recover from the effects of that fearful night among
the snow.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Ruxton&rsquo;s most agreeable excursions was to the
Boiling Spring River and the Boiling Fountains, which he found to
be situated in the midst of picturesque combinations of wood and
rock.&nbsp; These celebrated springs issue from round holes in a
large, flat white rock, at some distance from each other; the gas
escapes with a hissing sound, like that of water in a state of
ebullition; and the taste is <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>peculiarly refreshing, like that of,
but seeming more pungent than, the very best soda-water.&nbsp;
The Indians call them the &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; springs, and
regard them with superstitious reverence as the haunts of a
spirit, who, by breathing through the transparent fluid, causes
the perturbation of its surface.&nbsp; As to this water-spirit
the Arapahoes attribute the power of preventing the success or
bringing about the failure of their war expeditions, they never
pass the springs without leaving there some propitiatory
offerings, such as beads, wampum, knives, pieces of red cloth,
strips of deerskin, and mocassins.&nbsp; The country round about
was formerly in the hands of the Shoshone, or Snake Indians, of
whom the Comanches are a branch: the latter now dwell to the east
of the Rocky Mountains; the former to the west, or in the
recesses of the mountains themselves.</p>
<p>The Snake Indians connect a curious legend with these two
springs of sweet and bitter water.</p>
<p>They say that, hundreds of years ago, when the cotton-wood
trees on the Rio Colorado were no higher than arrows, and the red
man hunted the buffalo on the plains, all people spoke the same
language, and two parties of hunters never met without smoking
together the pipe of peace.&nbsp; In this happy age, it chanced
on one occasion that a couple of hunters, belonging to different
tribes, met on the bank of a small rivulet, in which they
designed to quench their thirst.&nbsp; A bright clear thread of
water, trickling from a spring in a rock a few feet from the
bank, it wound its silvery way into the river.&nbsp; Now, while
one of the hunters threw himself at once on the ground, and
plunged his face into the running stream, the other first flung
from his <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>back a fine deer, and then, turning towards the spring,
poured some of the water out as a libation to the Great Spirit,
who had rewarded his prowess with bow and arrow, and caused the
fountain to flow, at which he was about to refresh himself.</p>
<p>And it came to pass that the other hunter, who had killed no
fat buck, and had forgotten to make the usual peace-offering,
felt his heart swell with rage and jealousy; and the Evil Spirit
taking possession of him, he sought for an excuse to quarrel with
the stranger Indian.&nbsp; Rising to his feet with a moody frown
upon his brow, he exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does a stranger drink at the spring-head, when one
to whom the spring belongs is content to drink of the water that
runs from it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Great Spirit,&rdquo; replied the other,
&ldquo;places the cool water at the spring, that his children may
drink it pure and undefiled.&nbsp; The running water is for the
beasts that inhabit the plains.&nbsp; Au-sa-qua is a chief of the
Shoshone, and he drinks at the head of the waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Shoshone,&rdquo; answered the first speaker,
&ldquo;is but a tribe of the Comanche.&nbsp; Wa-co-mish is the
chief of the great nation.&nbsp; Why does a Shoshone dare to
drink above him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has said it.&nbsp; The Shoshone drinks at the
spring-head; let other nations be satisfied with the water of the
stream that runs into the fields.&nbsp; Au-sa-qua is chief of his
nation.&nbsp; The Comanche are brothers; let them both drink of
the same water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Shoshone pays tribute to the Comanche.&nbsp;
Wa-co-mish leads that nation to war.&nbsp; Wa-co-mish is chief of
the Shoshone, as he is of his own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&ldquo;Wa-co-mish lies,&rdquo; said Au-sa-qua coldly;
&ldquo;his tongue is forked like the rattlesnake&rsquo;s; his
heart is as black as the Misho-tunga (evil spirit).&nbsp; When
the Manitou made his children, whether Shoshone or Comanche,
Arapaho, Shi-an, or P&aacute;-ui, he gave them buffalo to eat,
and the pure water of the crystal fountain to quench their
thirst.&nbsp; He said not to one, &lsquo;Drink here,&rsquo; or to
the other, &lsquo;Drink there,&rsquo; but gave to all the bright
clear fountain, that all might drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tempest of fury swept over the soul of Wa-comish as he
listened to these words; but he was a coward at heart, and durst
not openly encounter the cooler and more courageous
Shoshone.&nbsp; But when the latter, hot with speaking, again
stooped to drink of the refreshing waters, Wa-co-mish suddenly
threw himself upon him, pressed his head beneath the surface, and
held it there, until his victim, suffocated, ceased to struggle,
and fell forward into the spring, dead.</p>
<p>The murderer had satisfied his passion; but was he
happy?&nbsp; No; as he gazed at the corpse of his victim, he was
seized with a passionate sense of remorse and regret.&nbsp;
Loathing himself for the crime he had committed, he proceeded to
drag the body a few paces from the water, which, thereupon, was
suddenly disturbed.&nbsp; The wave trembled to and fro, and
bubbles, rising to the surface, escaped in hissing gas.&nbsp;
And, as a vaporous cloud gradually rose and sank, the figure of
an aged Indian was revealed to the murderer&rsquo;s straining
eyes, whom, by his noble countenance, his long sinewy hand, and
his silvery beard, he knew to be the great Wau-kan-aga, the
father of the Shoshone and Comanche nation, still <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>remembered
and revered for the good deeds and the heroic acts he had done in
life.</p>
<p>Stretching out a war-club towards the shrinking, trembling
Wa-co-mish, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accursed of my tribe! this day hast thou snapt the link
that bound together the mightiest nations of the world, while the
blood of the brave Shoshone cries to the Manitou for
vengeance.&nbsp; May the water of thy tribe be rank and bitter in
their throats!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, swinging round his ponderous
war-club, he dashed out the brains of the treacherous Comanche,
so that he fell headlong into the spring, which, from that day,
has ever been nauseous to the taste, and an offence to thirsty
lips.&nbsp; But at the same time, to preserve the memory of the
noble Au-sa-qua, he struck a hard flint rock, higher up the
rivulet, with his club, and called forth a fountain of crystal
water, which, even in our own times, is the joy and the delight
of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; says Mr. Ruxton, &ldquo;never was there
such a paradise for hunters as this lone and solitary spot.&nbsp;
The shelving prairie, at the bottom of which the springs are
situated, is entirely surrounded by rugged mountains, and,
containing perhaps about two or three acres of excellent grass,
affords a safe pasture to their animals, which would hardly care
to wander from such feeding.&nbsp; Immediately overhead,
Pike&rsquo;s Peak, at an elevation of 12,000 feet above the level
of the sea, towers high into the clouds; whilst from the
fountain, like a granitic amphitheatre, ridge after ridge,
clothed with pine and cedar, rises and meets the stupendous mass
of mountains, well called &lsquo;Rocky,&rsquo; which stretches
far away north and <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>southward, their gigantic peaks being visible above the
strata of clouds which hide their rugged bases.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But here our companionship with Mr. Ruxton ceases.&nbsp; His
travels in the United States do not present any uncommon or
remarkable feature; do not differ from those of the thousand and
one sightseers who yearly cross the Atlantic, and survey the
broad territories of the great Western Republic.&nbsp; With a
small party he crossed the wide-rolling prairies to Fort
Leavenworth; thence, passing the Kansas or Caro river, and
entering upon a picturesque country of hill and dale, well wooded
and watered, he penetrated into the valley of the Missouri.&nbsp;
Down that noble stream he made his way to St. Louis, and
afterwards traversed the prairies of Illinois to Chicago; not
then, as it is now, the capital of the West, and the great corn
dep&ocirc;t of the Mississippi States.&nbsp; From Chicago he
crossed Lake Michigan to Kalamazoo, where he took the rail to
Detroit.&nbsp; A Canadian steamer conveyed him to Buffalo.&nbsp;
Thence, by rail, he travelled to Albany, and descended the
majestic Hudson to New York.&nbsp; His home voyage was swift and
prosperous, and he arrived at Liverpool in the middle of August,
1847. <a name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"

<h2><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>DOCTOR
BARTH,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND CENTRAL AFRICA.</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center">A.D. 1850.</p>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Heinrich Barth</span>, a native of
Hamburg, and lecturer at the University of Berlin upon geography,
had already had some experience of African travel, when, in 1849,
he learned that Mr. James Richardson had planned an expedition
from London to Central Africa, with the view of opening up the
Soudan to European commerce, and substituting for the cruel
slave-trade the legitimate enterprise of working the natural
riches of the country.&nbsp; Dr. Barth obtained permission to
accompany it, and with another volunteer, also a German, named
Overweg, he repaired to head-quarters.&nbsp; The expedition was
authorized and supported by the British Government.&nbsp; It met,
therefore, with no preliminary difficulties; and we may begin our
summary of its adventures at Tripoli, whence it started for the
south on the 24th of March, 1850.&nbsp; Entering the Fezzan, it
crossed the rocky and elevated plateau known as the Hammada, and
through fertile wadys, or valley-basins, separated by precipitous
ridges and broad <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>wastes of sand, made its way to Mourzouk, the capital,
situated in a sandy plain, where agricultural labour is possible
only under the shelter of the date-palms.&nbsp; The town has no
rich merchants, and is not so much a commercial dep&ocirc;t as a
place of transit.&nbsp; For Dr. Barth and his companions it was,
however, the first stage of their journey, and, indeed, their
true point of departure.&nbsp; They made all haste, therefore, to
leave it, and on the 13th of June entered upon their great
undertaking.&nbsp; On the 25th, after an unavoidable delay, they
quitted Tasua, crossed a considerable mass of sand-hills, and
descended into a more agreeable district, where the heights were
crowned by tamarisk trees, each height standing alone and
isolated, like sentinels along the front of an army.&nbsp; This
pleasant variety of scenery did not last long, however; they came
again upon a soil as rocky as that of the Hammada, and met with
an alternation of green valleys and sterile promontories, similar
to that which they had explored before they reached Mourzouk.</p>
<p>They had reached the Wady Elaveu, a huge depression running
north and south, when, at a distance of two hundred yards from
their camp, they discovered a pond, forming a centre of life in
that solitary region.&nbsp; Everybody hastened to enjoy a bath; a
crowd of pintados and gangas hovered, with bright-coloured wings,
above the laughing, frolicking company, waiting until they could
take their places.&nbsp; While in this vicinity the travellers
were disturbed by the conduct of some Towaregs, who had been
engaged to conduct them to Selompih.&nbsp; Eventually, some
slight change was made in the plans of the expedition, which, <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>it was
determined, should go on to Ghat, and remain there for six days;
while the Towaregs, on their part, undertook to set out
immediately afterwards for the Asben.&nbsp; Striking into the
valley of Tanesof, they saw before them, revelling in the glow
and gleam of the sunset, the Demons&rsquo; Mountain, or Mount
Iniden; its perpendicular summit, adorned with towers and
battlements, showed its white outlines vividly against a
dark-blue sky.&nbsp; Westward, the horizon was bounded by a range
of sand-hills, which the wind swept like a mighty besom, filling
the air with sharp, gritty sand, and covering the entire surface
of the valley.</p>
<p>On the following morning, their course carried them towards an
enchanted mountain, which the wild legends of the natives have
invested with picturesque interest.&nbsp; In spite of the
warnings of the Towaregs, or perhaps because they had cautioned
Dr. Barth not to risk his life in scaling that palace of the evil
spirits, he resolved on attempting the sacrilegious
enterprise.&nbsp; Unable to obtain guides, neither threats nor
bribes prevailing over their superstitious terrors, he set out
alone, in the belief that it had been formerly a place of
religious worship, and that he should find there either
sculptures or curious inscriptions.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he took
with him no provisions but some biscuits and dates, and worse
food cannot be imagined where there is a want of water.&nbsp;
Crossing the sand-hills, he entered upon a bare and sterile
plain, strewn with black pebbles, and studded with little mounds
or hillocks of the same colour.&nbsp; Then he followed the bed of
a torrent, its banks dotted with herbage, which offered an asylum
to a couple of antelopes.&nbsp; Anxious for the safety of their
young, the timid animals did <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>not move at his approach.&nbsp;
Affection inspired them with courage; they raised their heads
boldly, and waved their tails.&nbsp; The enchanted palace seemed
to recede as he advanced; finding himself in front of a dark deep
ravine, he changed his course, only to find the passage barred by
a precipice.&nbsp; Under the glare and glow of a burning sun he
undauntedly pursued his way, and at last, spent with fatigue and
exertion, reached the summit, which was only a few feet wide, and
could boast neither of sculptures nor inscriptions.</p>
<p>From so lofty a watch-tower the prospect was necessarily
extensive; but on surveying the plain below with anxious glance,
Dr. Barth failed to detect any sign of the caravan.&nbsp; He was
hungry and athirst; but his dates and biscuit were not eatable,
and his supply of water was so limited that he durst not indulge
himself with more than a mouthful.&nbsp; Feeble and spent as he
was, to descend was imperative; he had no water left when he once
more stood upon the plain.&nbsp; He dragged his weary limbs
onward for some time, but at length was forced to own to himself
that he did not know the direction he ought to take.&nbsp; He
fired his pistol; but it elicited no reply.&nbsp; Wandering
further and further from the route, he came upon a small grassy
oasis, where some huts had been constructed of the branches of
the tamarisk.&nbsp; With hopeful heart he hurried towards them;
they were empty.&nbsp; Then in the distance he saw a long train
of loaded camels ploughing their slow way through the sand; no,
it was an illusion!&mdash;the illusion of fever.&nbsp; When night
fell, he descried a fire gleaming redly against the darkened sky;
it must be that of the caravan!&nbsp; Again he fired his pistol,
and again there <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>was no answer.&nbsp; Still the flame rose steadily
towards heaven, and seemed to beckon him to a place where he
should find rest and safety; but he was unable to profit by the
signal.&nbsp; He fired again; no answering sound came forth from
the silence of the mysterious night, and Dr. Barth, on his knees,
entrusted his life to the Divine Mercy, and waited and watched
for the dawn of day.&nbsp; The dawn came, as it comes to all
God&rsquo;s creatures, whether rich or poor, happy or
wretched&mdash;comes with a blessing and a promise that are too
often accepted without thought or emotion of gratitude; the dawn
came, and still the calm of the desert remained unbroken.&nbsp;
He loaded his pistol with a double charge, and the report,
travelling from echo to echo, seemed loud enough to awaken the
dead; it was heard by no human ear but his own.&nbsp; The sun,
for whose beams he had prayed in the night-watches, rose in all
its glory; the heat became intense; slowly the belated wayfarer
crawled along the hot sand to seek the scanty shelter afforded by
the leafless branches of the tamarisk.&nbsp; At noon there was
scarcely shade enough to protect even his head, and in an agony
of thirst, he opened a vein, drank a little of his own blood, and
lost all consciousness.&nbsp; When he recovered his senses, the
sun had set behind the mountain.&nbsp; He dragged himself a few
paces from the tamarisk, and was examining the dreary level with
sorrowful eyes, when he suddenly heard the voice of a
camel.&nbsp; Never had he listened to music so delightful!&nbsp;
For twenty-four hours had his sufferings been prolonged, and he
was completely exhausted when rescued by one of the Towaregs of
the caravan who had been sent in search of him.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>The
caravan spent six days in the double oasis of Ghat and Barakat,
where crops of green millet, taking the place of barley and rye,
indicated the neighbourhood of Nigriti&aacute;.&nbsp; The gardens
were neatly fenced and carefully cultivated; turtle-doves and
pigeons cooed among the branches; the clean, well-built houses
were each provided with a terraced roof.&nbsp; Dr. Barth observed
that the male inhabitants worked with industry and intelligence;
as for the women, almost every one had a babe on her shoulders,
and children swarmed by the wayside.&nbsp; As a whole, the
population was far superior, physically and morally, to the
mixed, hybrid race of the Fezzan.</p>
<p>They left the gracious and grateful oasis to plunge into the
desert, a chaos of sandstone and granite rocks.&nbsp; On the 30th
of July, they reached the junction-point of two ravines which
formed a sort of &ldquo;four-ways&rdquo; among these confused
masses.&nbsp; The wady which crossed their route was about sixty
feet broad, but, at a short distance, narrowed suddenly into a
defile between gigantic precipices upwards of a thousand feet in
height&mdash;a defile which in the rainy season must be converted
into a veritable cataract, to judge from an excavated basin at
the mouth, which, when Dr. Barth and his companions passed, was
full of fresh and limpid water.&nbsp; This
&ldquo;four-ways,&rdquo; and these defiles, form the valley of
Agu&eacute;ri, long known to European geographers by the name of
Ama&iuml;s.</p>
<p>The unpleasant intelligence now arrived that a powerful chief,
named Sidi-Jalef-Sakertaf, projected an expedition against their
peaceful caravan.&nbsp; Fortunately, it was only a question of
the tribute which, by right of might, the Towaregs levy from
every <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>caravan that crosses the desert.&nbsp;
Sidi-Jalef-Sakertaf was pacified; and the enthusiasts went on
their way through sterile valleys and frowning defiles that would
have daunted the courage of any but a votary of science and
adventure.</p>
<p>They next arrived at Mount Tiska, which is six hundred feet in
height, and surrounded by numerous lesser cones.&nbsp; It forms a
kind of geological landmark; for the soil, hitherto so broken and
irregular, thenceforward becomes smooth and uniform, while rising
gradually, and the vast plain stretches far beyond the limit of
vision without anything to interrupt its arid monotony.&nbsp; A
two days&rsquo; journey brought our travellers to the well of
Afelesselez.&nbsp; It is utterly wanting in shade; only a few
clumps of stunted tamarisks grow on the sandy hillocks; but,
desolate as it is and uninviting, the caravans resort to it
eagerly, on account of its supply of fresh water.</p>
<p>Sand; stones; little ridges of quartzose limestone; granite
mixed with red sandstone or white; a few mimosas, at intervals of
one or two days&rsquo; march; abrupt pinnacles breaking the dull
level of the sandstones; dry and bushless valleys&mdash;such were
the features of the country through which Dr. Barth and his
companions wearily plodded.&nbsp; Herds of buffaloes, however,
are numerous; as is also, in the higher ground, the <i>Ovis
tragelaphis</i>.</p>
<p>On the 16th of August the travellers, while descending a rocky
crest covered with gravel, came in sight of Mount Asben.&nbsp;
The Asben or A&rsquo;ir is an immense oasis, which has some claim
to be considered the Switzerland of the Desert.&nbsp; The route
pursued by Dr. Barth on his way to Agadez traversed its most <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>picturesque
portion, where, almost every moment, the great mountain revealed
itself, with its winding gorges, its fertile basins, and its
lofty peaks.</p>
<p>Agadez is built on a plain, where it seems to lament that the
day of its prosperity has passed.&nbsp; At one time it was the
centre of a considerable commerce; but, since the close of the
last century, its population has sunk from sixty thousand to
seven or eight thousand souls.&nbsp; Most of its houses lie in
ruins; the score of habitations which compose the palace are
themselves in a deplorably dilapidated condition; of the seventy
mosques which it previously boasted only two remain.&nbsp; The
richer merchants shun the market of Agadez, which is now in the
possession of the Touats, and supported by small traders, who do
a little business in the purchase of millet when the price is
low.</p>
<p>The day after his arrival, Barth repaired to the palace, and
found that the buildings reserved for the sovereign were in
tolerably good repair.&nbsp; He was introduced into a hall, from
twelve to fifteen yards square, with a low da&iuml;s or platform,
constructed of mats placed upon branches, which supported four
massive columns of clay.&nbsp; Between one of these columns and
the angle of the wall was seated Abd-el-Kadir, the Sultan, a
vigorous and robust man of about fifty years old, whose grey robe
and white scarf indicated that he did not belong to the race of
the Towaregs.&nbsp; Though he had never heard of England, he
received Dr. Barth very kindly, expressed his indignation at the
treatment the caravans had undergone on the frontier of
A&rsquo;ir, and, by-and-by, sent him letters of recommendation to
the governors of Kan&oacute;, Kats&eacute;na, <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>and
Daoura.&nbsp; Dr. Barth remained for two months at Agadez, and
collected a number of interesting details respecting its
inhabitants and their mode of life.&nbsp; Thus, he describes a
visit which he paid to one of its more opulent female
inhabitants.&nbsp; She lived in a spacious and commodious
house.&nbsp; When he called upon her, she was attired in a robe
of silk and cotton, and adorned with a great number of silver
jewels.&nbsp; Twenty persons composed her household; including
six children, entirely naked, their bracelets and collars of
silver excepted, and six or seven slaves.&nbsp; Her husband lived
at Kats&eacute;na, and from time to time came to see her; but it
appears that she scarcely awaited his visits with the loving
expectancy of a Penelope.&nbsp; No rigid seclusion of women is
insisted upon at Agadez.&nbsp; During the Sultan&rsquo;s absence,
five or six young females presented themselves at Dr.
Barth&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Two of them were rather handsome, with
black hair falling down their shoulders in thick plaits, quick
lively eyes, dark complexion, and a toilette not wanting in
elegance; but they were so importunate for presents, that Dr.
Barth, to escape their incessant petitions, shut himself up.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Barth rejoined his companions in the valley of
Tin-Teggana.&nbsp; On the 12th of December they resumed their
march, crossing a mountainous region, intersected by fertile
valleys, in which the Egyptian balanite and indigo flourished,
and finally emerging on the plain which forms the transition
between the rocky soil of the desert and the fertile region of
the Soudan&mdash;a sandy plain, the home of the giraffe and the
antelope leucoryx.&nbsp; By degrees it became pleasantly green <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>with
brushwood; then the travellers caught sight of bands of
ostriches, of numerous burrows, especially in the neighbourhood
of the ant-hills, and those of the Ethiopian orycteropus, which
have a circumference of three yards to three yards and a half,
and are constructed with considerable regularity.</p>
<p>The wood grew thicker, the ground more broken, the ant-hills
more numerous.&nbsp; As the travellers descended an abrupt
decline of about one hundred feet, they found the character of
the vegetation entirely changed.&nbsp; Melons were abundant; the
dilon, a kind of laurel, dominated in the woods; then appeared an
euphorbia, a somewhat rare tree in this part of Africa, in the
poisonous juice of which the natives steep their arrows;
parasites were frequent, but as yet lacked strength and pith; in
a pool some cows were cooling themselves in the shades of the
mimosas that fringed its banks; the thick herbage flourishing
along the track impeded the progress of the camels, and against
the horizon were visible the fertile undulating meads of
Damerghue.&nbsp; Continuing their journey, they came upon a
scattered village, where, for the first time, they saw that kind
of architecture which, with some unimportant modifications,
prevails throughout Central Africa.&nbsp; Entirely constructed of
the stems of the sorghum and the <i>Asclepias gigas</i>, the huts
of Nigriti&aacute; have nothing of the solidity of the houses of
the A&rsquo;ir, where the framework is formed of the branches and
trunks of trees; but they are incontestably superior in
prettiness and cleanliness.&nbsp; The traveller, in examining
them, is impressed by their resemblance to the cabins of the
aborigines of Latium, of which Vitruvius, amongst others, has
furnished a <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>description.&nbsp; More remarkable still are the
millstones scattered round the huts; they consist of enormous
panniers of reeds, placed on a scaffolding two feet from the
ground, to protect them from the mice and termites.</p>
<p>On their arrival at Tagilet, the travellers separated.&nbsp;
Mr. James Richardson undertook the road to Zindu, Overweg that to
Mar&aacute;di, and Barth to Kan&oacute;.&nbsp;
K&uacute;k&aacute;wa was named as the place, and about the 1st of
April as the date, of their reassembling.&nbsp; Our business here
is with Dr. Barth.</p>
<p>At Tas&aacute;wa he gained his first experience of a large
town or village in Negroland proper; and it made a cheerful
impression upon him, as manifesting everywhere the unmistakable
marks of the comfortable, pleasant sort of life led by the
natives.&nbsp; The courtyard, fenced with a hedge of tall reeds,
excluded to a certain degree the gaze of the passer-by, without
securing to the interior absolute secrecy.&nbsp; Then, near the
entrance, were the cool and shady &ldquo;runf&aacute;,&rdquo; for
the reception of travellers and the conduct of ordinary business;
and the &ldquo;g&iacute;da,&rdquo; partly consisting entirely of
reed of the best wicker-work, partly built of clay in the lower
parts, while the roof is constructed only of reeds,&mdash;but
whatever the material employed, always warm and well adapted for
domestic privacy; while the entire dwelling is shaded with
spreading trees, and enlivened with groups of children, goats,
fowls, pigeons, and, where a little wealth has been accumulated,
a horse or a pack-ox.</p>
<p>Dr. Barth afterwards arrived at Kats&eacute;na, a town of
considerable size, with a population of eight thousand
souls.&nbsp; It was formerly the residence of one of the <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>richest and
most celebrated princes in Nigriti&aacute;, though he paid a
tribute of a hundred slaves to the King of Bornu as a sign of
allegiance.</p>
<p>For two centuries, from 1600 to 1800, Kats&eacute;na appears
to have been the principal town in this part of the Soudan.&nbsp;
Its social condition, developed by contact with the Arabs, then
reached its highest degree of civilization; the language, rich in
form and pure in pronunciation, and the polished and refined
manners of the inhabitants, distinguished it from the other towns
of the H&aacute;usa.&nbsp; But a complete and pitiful change took
place when, in 1807, the Fulbi, raised to the highest pitch of
fanaticism by the preaching of the reformer, Othm&aacute;n dan
F&oacute;diye, succeeded in gaining possession of the town.&nbsp;
The principal foreign merchants then emigrated to Kan&oacute;;
the Asben&aacute;wa also transferred their salt-market thither;
and Kats&eacute;na, notwithstanding its excellent position and
greater salubrity, is now but of secondary importance as the seat
of a governor.&nbsp; Mohammed Bello, who held that post at the
time of Barth&rsquo;s visit, either through capriciousness or
suspicion, was very desirous of sending him on to Sokoto, the
residence of the Emir.&nbsp; At first he employed persuasion, and
when that failed, resorted to force, detaining Barth a prisoner
for five days.&nbsp; However, the energy and perseverance of the
traveller overcame every difficulty; and, having obtained his
freedom, he directed his steps towards the celebrated commercial
entrep&ocirc;t of the Central Soudan.</p>
<p>Kan&oacute;, as he says, was an important station for him, not
only from a scientific, but a financial point of view.&nbsp;
After the extortions of the Towaregs, and his <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>long delay
in A&rsquo;ir, he was entirely dependent upon the merchandise
which had been forwarded thither in advance.&nbsp; On his
arrival, he had to liquidate a debt which had risen to the large
amount of 113,200 kurdi; and he was much disheartened by the low
value set upon the wares which were his sole resource.&nbsp;
Lodged in dark and uncomfortable quarters, destitute of money,
beset by his numerous creditors, and treated with insolence by
his servant, his position in the far-famed African city, which
had so long occupied his thoughts and excited his imagination,
was the reverse of agreeable.&nbsp; Anxiety acted upon his
physical health, and a severe attack of fever reduced him to a
state of great weakness.&nbsp; Yet the gloomy colours in which he
naturally paints his own condition do not extend to his
description of Kan&oacute;.&nbsp; <i>That</i> is bright, vivid,
and graphic.</p>
<p>The whole scenery of the town&mdash;with its great variety of
clay houses, huts, and sheds; its patches of green pasture for
oxen, horses, camels, donkeys, and goats; its deep hollows
containing ponds overgrown with water-plants; its noble trees,
the symmetric g&oacute;nda or papaya, the slender date-palm, the
spreading all&eacute;luba, and the majestic bombyx, or
silk-cotton tree; the inhabitants, gay in diversified costumes,
from the half-naked slave to the most elaborately dressed
Arab&mdash;forms an animated picture of a world complete in
itself; a strange contrast to European towns in external form,
and yet, after all, in social inequalities, in the difference of
happiness and comfort, activity and laziness, luxury and poverty,
exactly similar.</p>
<p>Here a row of shops is filled with articles of native and
foreign produce, with noisy buyers and <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>sellers in
every variety of figure, complexion, and dress, yet all intent
upon gain, and endeavouring to get the advantage of each other;
there, a large shed, like a hurdle, full of half-naked,
half-starved slaves, torn from their quiet homes, from their
wives, husbands, parents, arranged in rows like cattle, and
staring with hopeless eyes upon the purchasers, wondering,
perhaps, into whose hands it would be their lot to fall.&nbsp;
How dark to them the mystery of life!&nbsp; In another part may
be seen all that can minister to human ease and comfort, and the
wealthy buying dainties and delicacies for his table, while the
poor man eyes wistfully a handful of grain.&nbsp; Here a rich
governor, dressed in silk and gaudy clothes, mounted upon a
spirited and richly caparisoned horse, is followed by a troop of
idle, insolent menials; there, a blind pauper gropes his way
through the restless, excited multitude, and fears at every step
to be trodden underfoot.&nbsp; Observe yonder a yard neatly
fenced with mats of reed, and provided with all the comforts
which the country affords; a clean, neat-looking cottage, with
nicely polished clay walls, a shutter of reeds placed against the
low, well-rounded door, to forbid abrupt intrusion on the privacy
of domestic life; a cool shed for the daily household work; a
fine spreading all&eacute;luba tree, affording a pleasant shade
in the noontide hours, or a stately g&oacute;nda or papaya
lifting its crown of feather-like leaves on a slender, smooth,
and undivided stem, or the tall and useful date-tree, adding its
charm to the fair scene of domestic peace and comfort,&mdash;the
matron, in a clean black cotton gown wound round her waist, and
with her hair trimly dressed, busily preparing the meal for her
absent husband, or <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>spinning cotton, and at the same time urging the female
slaves to pound the corn; the children, naked and merry, playing
about in the sand, or chasing a straggling, stubborn goat;
earthenware pots and wooden bowls, cleanly washed, all standing
in order.&nbsp; Our survey also includes a
&ldquo;m&aacute;cin&aacute;&rdquo;&mdash;an open terrace of clay,
with a number of dyeing-pans, and people actively employed in
various processes of their handicraft: one man stirring the
juice, and mixing some colouring wood with the indigo in order to
secure the desired tint; another drawing a shirt from the
dye-pot, or suspending it to a rope fastened to the trees; and a
couple of men busily beating a well-dyed shirt, and singing the
while in good time and tune.&nbsp; Further on, a blacksmith with
rude tools that an European would disdain, is fashioning a
dagger, the sharpness of which will surprise you, or a formidable
barbed spear, or some implement of husbandry; beyond, men and
women turn an unfrequented thoroughfare to account by hanging up,
along the fences, their cotton thread for weaving; and, lastly,
close at hand, a group of loiterers idle away the sunny
hours.</p>
<p>Ever and anon comes upon the scene a caravan from
G&oacute;nja, with the much-prized kola-nut, chewed by all who
can spare as much or as little as &ldquo;ten kurdi;&rdquo; or a
caravan passes, laden with natron, bound for N&uacute;pa; or a
troop of Asben&aacute;wa, going off with their salt for the
neighbouring towns; or some Arabs lead their camels, heavily
charged with the luxuries of the north and east, to the quarters
of the opulent; or a troop of gaudy, warlike-looking horsemen
dash towards the palace of the governor with news from some
distant province.&nbsp; Everywhere you see human life in its <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>varied
forms, the brightest and the most gloomy closely mixed together,
as in life itself happiness and sorrow are never divided; every
variety of national form and complexion&mdash;the olive-coloured
Arab; the dark Kanuri, with his wide nostrils; the
small-featured, light, and slender Ba-Fillanchi; the broad-faced
Ba-W&aacute;ngara; the stout, large-boned, and masculine-looking
N&uacute;pa female; the well-proportioned and comely
Ba-Ha&uacute;she woman.</p>
<p>The regular population of Kan&oacute; numbers about 30,000
souls, but is raised to 60,000, from January to April, by the
influx of strangers.&nbsp; Its trade principally consists of
cotton stuffs sold under the form of tebi, a kind of blouse;
tenk&eacute;di, the long scarf or dark blue drapery worn by the
women; the zunie, a kind of plaid, very bright in colour; and the
black turban, worn by the Towaregs.&nbsp; At Kan&oacute; are
concentrated also the products of northern, eastern, and western
Africa, flowing thither through the channels of Mourzouk, Ghat,
Tripoli, Timb&uacute;ktu, and the whole of Born&uacute;.</p>
<p>Early in March the intrepid traveller resumed his journey,
across an open and pleasant country.&nbsp; At Zurrikulo he
entered Born&uacute; proper.&nbsp; The beautiful fan-palm was
here the prevailing tree; but as Barth advanced, he met with the
kuka, or <i>Adansonia digitata</i>, and the landscape brightened
with leafiness, and soon he entered upon a pleasant tract of
dense green underwood.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sky was clear,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;and I was leaning carelessly upon my little nag,
musing on the original homes of all the plants which now adorn
different countries, when I saw advancing towards us a
strange-looking person, of very fair complexion, richly dressed
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>and
armed, and accompanied by three men on horseback, likewise armed
with musket and pistols.&nbsp; Seeing that he was a person of
consequence, I rode quickly up to him and saluted him, when he,
measuring me with his eyes, halted and asked me whether I was the
Christian who was expected to arrive from Kan&oacute;; and on my
answering him in the affirmative, he told me distinctly that my
fellow-traveller, Yak&uacute;b (Mr. Richardson), had died before
reaching K&uacute;k&aacute;wa, and that all his property had been
seized.&nbsp; This sad intelligence deeply affected me; and, in
the first moment of excitement, I resolved to leave my two young
men behind with the camels, and to hurry on alone on
horseback.&nbsp; But as I could not reach K&uacute;k&aacute;wa in
less than four days, and as part of the road was greatly infested
by the Taw&aacute;rek (or Towaregs), such an attempt might have
exposed me to a great deal of inconvenience.&nbsp; Therefore, we
determined to go on as fast as the camels would allow
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four days later, and Dr. Barth saw before him the wall of
white clay which surrounds the capital of Born&uacute;.&nbsp; He
entered the gate, and of some people assembled there inquired the
way to the sheikh&rsquo;s residence.&nbsp; Passing the little
market-place, and following the dendal, or promenade, he rode
straight up to the palace which flanks the palace on the
east.&nbsp; The sheikh received him cordially, and provided him
with quarters closely adjoining the vizier&rsquo;s house; these
consisted of two immense courtyards, the more secluded of which
enclosed, besides a half-finished clay dwelling, a spacious and
neatly built hut, which, he ascertained, had been specially
prepared for the reception and accommodation of the English
mission.&nbsp; <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>It taxed all Dr. Barth&rsquo;s energy and perseverance
to obtain the restoration of Mr. Richardson&rsquo;s property; but
he finally succeeded.&nbsp; He also obtained a loan of money on
the credit of the British Government, which enabled him to
satisfy his creditors, pay Mr. Richardson&rsquo;s servants, and
provide for the prosecution of the labours which had been so
unhappily interrupted.</p>
<p>The capital of Born&uacute; consists of two towns, each
surrounded by a wall: one, inhabited by the rich, is well built,
and contains some very large residences; the other is a labyrinth
of narrow streets of small and squalid houses.&nbsp; Between the
two towns spreads an area of about eight hundred yards each way,
which, throughout its length, is traversed by a great highway,
serving as a channel of intercommunication.&nbsp; This area is
largely peopled; and a picturesque aspect it presents, with its
spacious mansions and thatched huts, its solid walls of mud and
its fences of reeds, varying in colour, according to their age,
from the brightest yellow to the deepest black.</p>
<p>In the surrounding district are numerous little villages,
hamlets, and isolated farms, all walled.&nbsp; Every Monday a
fair is held between two of these villages, lying beyond the
western gate; to which the inhabitant of the province brings, on
the back of his camel or his ox, his store of butter and corn,
with his wife perched upon the top of the burden; and the
Y&eacute;din&aacute;, that pirate of Lake Tchad, who attracts our
admiration by the delicacy of his features and the suppleness of
his figure, his dried fish, flesh of hippopotamus, and whips made
of the animal&rsquo;s leathery hide.&nbsp; Provisions are
abundant; but to lay in at one time a week&rsquo;s supply is a
wearisome and troublesome task, <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>and a task all the more wearisome
and burdensome, because there is no standard money for buying and
selling.&nbsp; The ancient standard of the country, the pound of
copper, has fallen into disuse; and the currency partly consists
of &ldquo;g&aacute;bag&aacute;,&rdquo; or cotton-strips, and
&ldquo;kung&oacute;na,&rdquo; or cowries.&nbsp; A small farmer,
who brings his corn to the market, will refuse cowries, however,
and will rarely accept of a dollar.&nbsp; The would-be purchaser,
therefore, must first exchange a dollar for cowries; then, with
the cowries, must buy a &ldquo;k&uacute;lgu,&rdquo; or shirt; and
in this way will be able at last to obtain the required quantity
of corn.</p>
<p>Provisions are not only abundant, but cheap, and the variety
is considerable.&nbsp; For corn,&mdash;wheat, rice, and millet;
for fruits,&mdash;ground-nuts, the bito, or fruit of the
<i>Balanites &AElig;gyptiaca</i>, a kind of <i>physalis</i>, the
African plum, the <i>Rhamnus lotus</i>, and the d&uacute;m-palm;
for vegetables&mdash;beans and onions, and the young leaves of
the monkey-bread tree.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Barth had spent three weeks at K&uacute;k&aacute;wa, when,
on the evening of the 14th of April, the Sheikh Omar and his
vizier departed on a short visit to Ngornu, and at their
invitation he followed next morning.&nbsp; The road thither was
marked with the monotony which distinguishes the neighbourhood of
the capital.&nbsp; At first, nothing is seen but the <i>Asclepias
gigas</i>; then some low bushes of cucifera; and gradually trees
begin to enliven the landscape.&nbsp; The path is broad and well
trodden, but generally consists of a deep sandy soil.&nbsp; There
are no villages along the road, but several at a little
distance.&nbsp; Two miles and a half from Ngornu the trees cease,
giving way to an <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>immense fertile plain where cereals are cultivated as
well as beans.</p>
<p>At Ngornu, the town of &ldquo;the blessing,&rdquo; our
traveller arrived about an hour after noon.&nbsp; The heat being
very great, the streets were almost deserted; but the houses, or
rather yards, were crowded, tents having been pitched for the
accommodation of the visitors.&nbsp; Except the sheikh&rsquo;s
residence, scarcely a clay house was to be seen; yet the town
gave a general impression of comfort and prosperity, and every
yard was fenced with new &ldquo;s&eacute;ggad&eacute;&rdquo;
mats, and well shaded by leafy koma-trees, while the huts were
large and spacious.</p>
<p>Early next morning the indefatigable traveller started forth
on horseback to refresh himself with a view of Lake Tchad, which
he supposed to be at no great distance, and of which he indulged
the brightest visions.&nbsp; But no shining expanse of fair
waters greeted his eye; wherever he directed his gaze, he saw
only an endless grassy, treeless plain, stretching to the
farthest horizon.&nbsp; At length, riding through grass of
constantly increasing freshness and luxuriance, he reached a
shallow swamp, the irregular and deeply indented margin of which
greatly impeded his progress.&nbsp; After struggling for some
time to get clear of it, and vainly straining his eyes to
discover a shimmer of water in the distance, he retraced his
steps.&nbsp; Mentioning on his return the ill success he had met
with, the vizier undertook to send some horsemen to conduct him
along the shore as far as K&aacute;wa, whence he could cross the
country to K&uacute;k&aacute;wa.</p>
<p>When the time came, however, the vizier&rsquo;s promise was
represented by two horsemen only.&nbsp; With them <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>Dr. Barth
started on his excursion, taking a north-east direction.&nbsp;
The broad grassy plain seemed to roll away to an immeasurable
distance, unrelieved by tree or shrub; not a living creature was
visible, and the hot rays of the sun fell all around like burning
arrows.&nbsp; After about half an hour&rsquo;s ride, he reached
swampy ground, through which he and his companions forced their
horses, often up to the saddle.&nbsp; Thus they arrived on the
margin of a fine open sheet of water, fringed thickly with
papyrus and tall reed, from ten to fourteen feet high, among
which wound and interwound the garlands of a yellow-flowered
climbing plant, called &ldquo;boibuje.&rdquo;&nbsp; Turning to
the north, and still pushing onward through deep water and grass,
he made a small creek called D&iacute;mbeb&uacute;, and caught
sight of a couple of small flat boats, each about twelve feet
long, and manned by a couple of men, who, on descrying the
stranger, pulled off from the shore.&nbsp; They were
B&uacute;dduma, or Y&eacute;din&aacute;, the pirates of the
Tchad, in search of human prey; and Dr. Barth hastened to warn of
their presence some villagers who had come to cut reeds for the
roofs of their huts, and evidently had not caught sight of their
enemies.&nbsp; He then continued his march.&nbsp; The sun&rsquo;s
heat was intense, but a fresh cooling breeze blowing from the
lagoon rendered it endurable.&nbsp; Large herds of kel&aacute;ra,
a peculiar kind of antelope, started up as he advanced, bounding
swiftly over the rushes, and sometimes swimming on the silent
waters.&nbsp; They are like the roe in shape and size, with their
under parts white as snow.&nbsp; At another creek, which the lake
pirates sometimes use as a harbour, river-horses abounded, and
the air echoed with their snorting.&nbsp; <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>This was
the easternmost period of Dr. Barth&rsquo;s ride; turning then a
little west from north, he and his escort marched over drier
pasture-grounds, and, in about three miles, struck a deeply
indented and well-sheltered creek, called
Ng&oacute;ma&iacute;en.&nbsp; Here the curiosity of the traveller
was rewarded by the sight of eleven boats of the
Y&eacute;din&aacute;.&nbsp; Each was about twenty feet long,
tolerably broad, with a low waist, and a high pointed prow.&nbsp;
They are made of the narrow planks of the f&oacute;go-tree,
fastened together with ropes from the d&uacute;m-palm, the holes
being stopped with bast.</p>
<p>Another ride, and Dr. Barth turned westward&mdash;a course
which brought him to Maduw&aacute;ri, a pleasant village, lying
in the shade of trees, where he resolved on halting for the
night.&nbsp; From its inhabitants, who belong to the tribe of the
Sag&aacute;rti, he obtained much information respecting the
numerous islands that stud the surface of the lake.&nbsp; They
also told him that the open water begun one day&rsquo;s voyage
from K&aacute;ya, the small harbour of Maduw&aacute;ri, and is
from one to two fathoms deep.&nbsp; It stretches from the mouth
of the Sh&aacute;ry towards the western shore; all the rest of
the lake consisting of swampy meadow-lands, occasionally
inundated.&nbsp; Next morning, on resuming his journey, he was
charmed by the bright and gracious picture before him.&nbsp;
Clear and unbroken were the lines of the horizon, the swampy
plain extending on the right towards the lake, and blending with
it, so as to allow the mind that delights in wandering over
distant regions a boundless expanse to rove in&mdash;an enjoyment
not to be found in mountainous regions, be the mountains ever so
distant.&nbsp; Thus they travelled slowly northwards, while the
sun <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>rose
over the patches of water which brightened the grassy plain; and
on their left the village displayed its snug yards and huts,
neatly fenced and shaded by spreading trees.&nbsp; At
D&oacute;goji he came upon a hamlet or station of
cattle-breeders, where a thousand head were collected; the
herdsmen being stationed on guard around them, armed with long
spears and light shields.&nbsp; Equidistant poles were fixed in
the ground, on which the butter was hung up in skins or in
vessels made of grass.</p>
<p>Turning to the eastward, Dr. Barth reached the creek
&ldquo;K&oacute;gorani,&rdquo; surrounded by a belt of dense
reeds, and was there joined by a K&aacute;nemma chief, named
Zaitchua, with five horsemen.&nbsp; The party rode on towards
Bol&egrave;, passing through very deep water, and obtained a view
of the widest part of the lake they had yet seen.&nbsp; A fine
open sheet of water, agitated by a light easterly wind, rippled
in sparkling waves upon the shore.&nbsp; A reedy forest spread
all around, while the surface was bright with aquatic plants,
chiefly the beautiful water-lily, or <i>Nymphoea lotus</i>.&nbsp;
Flocks of waterfowl of every description played about.&nbsp; At
length they reached K&aacute;wa, a large straggling village,
lying among magnificent trees, where Dr. Barth&rsquo;s&rsquo;
excursion terminated; thence he returned to
K&uacute;k&aacute;wa.</p>
<p>On the 7th of May he was joined there by Mr. Overweg, and the
two travellers immediately made their preparations for resuming
the work of exploration with which they had been charged by the
British Government.&nbsp; These were completed by the 29th of May
(1851), and the two travellers then set out for the southward,
accompanied by an officer of the <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>sheikh, and attended by a small
company of servants and warriors.&nbsp; A singular variety of
country greeted them as they moved forward: at first it was low
and swampy; then came a bare and arid soil, planted with
scattered tamarisks; next, a dense forest, partly inundated in
the rainy season, and, afterwards, a broad and fertile plain,
sprinkled with villages, and white with thriving crops of
cotton.&nbsp; This was the district of Uji, which comprises
several places of a considerable size.&nbsp; Thence they entered
upon a fine open country, a continuous corn-field, interrupted
only by pleasant villages, and shaded here and there by single
monkey-bread trees, or Adansonias, and various kinds of
fig-trees, with their succulent dark-green foliage, or large
fleshy leaves of emerald green.&nbsp; A fiumara, or water-course,
which rises near Al&aacute;w&oacute;, traverses the plain with
numerous curves and bends, and passing Dek&ugrave;a, falls into
the Tchad.&nbsp; The travellers crossed it twice before they
reached Mabani, a large and prosperous town, with a population of
nine or ten thousand souls, which covers the sides and summit of
a hill of sand.&nbsp; From this point their road lay through
fertile fields, where they were greeted by the sight of the first
corn-crop of the season, its fresh and vivid green sparkling
daintily in the sunshine.&nbsp; Having crossed and recrossed the
fiumara, they ascended its steep left bank, which in some places
exhibited regular strata of sandstone.&nbsp; Here they passed a
little dyeing-yard of two or three pots, while several patches of
indigo flourished at the foot of the bank, and a bustling group
of men and cattle were gathered round the well.&nbsp; Villages
were seen lying about in every direction; and single cottages,
scattered about <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>here and there, gave evidence of a sense of
security.&nbsp; The corn-fields were most agreeably broken by
tracts covered with bushes of the wild g&oacute;nda, which has a
most delicious fruit, of a fine creamy flavour, and of the size
of a peach, but with a much larger stone.</p>
<p>Mount D&eacute;labida marked the border line of a mountainous
region.&nbsp; After entering upon the district of Shamo, Barth
observed that millet became rare, and that the sorghum was
generally cultivated.&nbsp; Here he and his party were joined by
some native traders; for robbers haunted the neighbourhood, and
safety was to be found in numbers.&nbsp; At every step they came
upon evidences of the misfortunes which had swept and scathed the
country: traces of ancient cultivation and ruined huts; and thick
interwoven jungles, where the grass grew so high as to hide both
horse and rider.&nbsp; After three hours&rsquo; march through
this land of desolation, they arrived at what had once been a
considerable village, but was then inhabited only by a few
natives, recently converted to the religion of the
Crescent.&nbsp; As but a single hut could be found for the
accommodation of the whole company, Dr. Barth preferred to encamp
in the open air.&nbsp; But he had scarcely laid down to rest,
when a terrible storm arose, sweeping his tent to the ground, and
flooding his baggage with torrents of rain.&nbsp; To such
adventures is the daring traveller exposed!</p>
<p>Though they had embraced Islam, the natives wore no other
clothing than a strip of leather passed between the legs, and
even this seemed by some of them to be considered a
superfluity.&nbsp; The observer could not fail to remark their
harmonious proportions, their regular features, undisfigured by
tattooing, <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>and, in not a few cases, presenting no resemblance to
the negro type.&nbsp; The difference of complexion noticeable in
individuals presumably of the same race, was remarkable.&nbsp;
With some it was a brilliant black; with others a rhubarb colour,
and there was no example of an intermediate tint; the black,
however, predominated.&nbsp; A young woman and her son, aged
eight years, formed a group &ldquo;quite antique,&rdquo; and
worthy of the chisel of a great artist.&nbsp; The child,
especially, in no respect yielded to the ancient Discophorus; his
hair was short and curled, but not woolly; his complexion, like
that of his mother and the whole family, was of a pale or
yellowish red.</p>
<p>Re-entering the forest, Dr. Barth observed that the clearings
bore the imprints of the feet of elephants of all ages.&nbsp; A
wealth of flowers loaded the atmosphere with fragrant
incense.&nbsp; But the soil soon deteriorated; the trees were
nearly all mimosas, and nearly all of indifferent growth, with
here and there a large leafless Adansonia flinging abroad, as if
in despair, its gaunt gigantic arms; while the herbage consisted
only of single tufts of coarse grass, four or five feet
high.&nbsp; When things are at their worst they begin to mend;
and for the traveller there is no motto more applicable than the
old proverb, that it is a long lane which has no turning.&nbsp;
With intense delight Dr. Barth and his companions saw the
monotonously gloomy forest giving way to scattered clusters of
large and graceful trees, such as generally indicate the
neighbourhood of human labour.&nbsp; And they soon emerged upon
bright green meadow-lands extending to the base of the Wandala
mountain-range, which rose like a barrier of cloud upon the
horizon, from north to south.&nbsp; The <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>highest
elevation of this range is about 3000 feet; its average elevation
does not exceed 2500 feet.&nbsp; Behind it, to a point of 5000
feet above the sea, rises the conical mass of Mount Mendefi,
first seen by gallant Major Denham.&nbsp; The country now
gradually assumed a wilder aspect; rocks of sandstone and granite
projected on all sides, while, in front, a little rocky ridge,
densely crowded with bush and tree, seemed to form a <i>ne plus
ultra</i>.&nbsp; Suddenly, however, a deep recess opened in it,
and a village was seen, lying most picturesquely in the heart of
the rocks and woods.&nbsp; This was Lah&aacute;ula, where the
travellers rested for the night.&nbsp; Next day they reached Uba,
on the border of A&rsquo;dam&aacute;wa; A&rsquo;dam&aacute;wa,
described by Dr. Barth as &ldquo;a Mohammedan kingdom engrafted
upon a mixed stock of pagan tribes&mdash;the conquest of the
valorous and fanatic P&aacute;llo chieftain, A&rsquo;d&aacute;ma,
over the great pagan kingdom of F&uacute;mbin&aacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the camels greatly excited the curiosity of the
population; for they are rarely seen in A&rsquo;dam&aacute;wa,
the climate of which these animals are unable to endure for any
length of time.&nbsp; Still more vivid was the curiosity of the
governor and his courtiers, when they saw Dr. Barth&rsquo;s
compass, chronometer, telescope, and the small print of his
Prayer-Book.&nbsp; The Fulbi, he says, are intelligent and
civilized, but prone to malice; they lack the good nature of the
real blacks, from whom they differ more in their character than
their colour.</p>
<p>At Bagma our travellers were struck by the size and shape of
the huts, some of them being from forty to sixty feet long, about
fifteen broad, and from ten to twelve feet high.&nbsp; They
narrowed above to a ridge, and were thatched all over, no
distinction being made between roof and wall.&nbsp; They are so
spaciously <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>constructed, in order to provide a shelter for the
cattle against the inclemency of the weather.&nbsp; The river
separates the village, which is inhabited entirely by
Mohammedans, into two quarters.&nbsp; &ldquo;The news of a
marvellous novelty soon stirred up the whole place, and young and
old, male and female, all gathered round our motley troop, and
thronged about us in innocent mirth, and as we proceeded the
people came running from the distant fields to see the wonder;
but the wonder was not myself, but the camel, an animal which
many of them had never seen, fifteen years having elapsed since
one had passed along this road.&nbsp; The chorus of shrill
voices, &lsquo;Gel&oacute;ba, gel&oacute;ba!&rsquo; was led by
two young wanton P&uacute;llo girls, slender as antelopes, and
wearing nothing but a light apron of striped cotton round their
loins, who, jumping about and laughing at the stupidity of these
enormous animals, accompanied us for about two miles along the
fertile plain.&nbsp; We passed a herd of about three hundred
cattle.&nbsp; Gradually the country became covered with forest,
with the exception of patches of cultivated ground.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Through scenery of this interesting character, the travellers
pushed on to Mbtudi.</p>
<p>Next day their route laid through well-wooded and well-watered
pastures, and immense fields of millet and ground-nuts, which
here form as large a proportion of the food of the people as
potatoes do in Europe.&nbsp; Dr. Barth liked them very much,
especially if roasted, for nibbling after supper, or even as a
substitute for breakfast on the road.&nbsp; From Segero the
travellers proceeded to Sara&rsquo;wu, and thence to
B&eacute;hur.&nbsp; Forest and cultivated land alternated with
one another to the margin of a little lake, lying in a belt of
tall thick <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>grass, where the unwieldy river-horse snorted
loud.&nbsp; The sky was dark with clouds, and a storm was
gathering, when the caravan entered the narrow streets of
Sall&eacute;ri.&nbsp; That night it obtained but scanty
accommodation, and everybody was glad to find the next morning
bright and cheerful, so that the march could be resumed.&nbsp;
Their course was directed towards the river
B&eacute;nuw&eacute;.&nbsp; The neighbourhood of the water was
first indicated by numerous high ant-hills, which, arranged in
almost parallel lines, presented a sufficiently curious
spectacle.&nbsp; To the north-west towered the insulated colossal
mass of Mount Atlantika, forming a conspicuous and majestic
object in the landscape.&nbsp; The savannas were now overgrown
with tall rank grass, and broken by many considerable pools,
lying in deep hollows; every year, in the rainy season, they are
under water.&nbsp; Crossing these low levels with some
difficulty, Dr. Barth arrived on the banks of the
B&eacute;nuw&eacute;.&nbsp; A broad and noble stream, it flowed
from east to west through an entirely open country.&nbsp; The
banks were twenty to thirty feet high; while, immediately
opposite to the traveller&rsquo;s station, behind a pointed
headland of sand, the river F&aacute;ro, which has its source on
the eastern side of Mount Atlantika, came in with a bold sweep
from the south-east, and poured its tributary waters into the
B&eacute;nuw&eacute;.&nbsp; The B&eacute;nuw&eacute;, below the
point of junction, bends slightly to the north, runs along the
northern foot of Mount B&aacute;gel&eacute;, thence traverses the
mountainous region of the B&aacute;chama and Zina to
Ham&aacute;rruwa and the industrious country of Kor&oacute;rofa,
until it joins the great western river of the Kw&aacute;ra, or
Niger.</p>
<p>The passage of the B&eacute;nuw&eacute;, which is here about
<a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>eight
hundred yards wide, was safely accomplished in the native canoes,
nor did any mishap occur in the transit of the F&aacute;ro, which
measures about six hundred yards.&nbsp; The current of the
F&aacute;ro has a velocity of about five miles an hour; that of
the B&eacute;nuw&eacute; does not exceed three miles and a
half.&nbsp; By way of Mount B&aacute;gel&eacute;, and through the
rich low lands of Rib&aacute;go, the travellers repaired to Yola,
the capital of A&rsquo;dam&aacute;wa.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>Yola, the capital of A&rsquo;dam&aacute;wa, lies four degrees
to the south of Kuka, on the F&aacute;ro, in a marshy plain,
which presents nothing attractive to the eye of an artist.&nbsp;
Dr. Barth describes it as a large open place, consisting mainly
of conical huts, surrounded by spacious court-yards, and even by
corn-fields; only the houses of the governor and his brothers
being built of clay.&nbsp; When he entered it, Lowel, the
governor, was in his fields, and could not be seen; but on his
return the travellers proceeded to his &ldquo;palace&rdquo; to
pay their respects.&nbsp; They were not allowed an interview,
however, until the following day, and then it was anything but
satisfactory.&nbsp; The officer who had accompanied them from
Kuka took the opportunity of delivering certain despatches; and
as they proved displeasing to the governor, he immediately vented
his wrath upon Dr. Barth, accusing him of treacherous
intentions.&nbsp; The audience terminated in confusion, and next
day but one, Dr. Barth was ordered to leave Yola, on the pretence
that his sojourn there could not be allowed unless he obtained <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>the
authorization of the Sultan of Sokoto.&nbsp; He was suffering
from fever, and the heat of the day was excessive, but at once
made preparations for departure.&nbsp; Sitting firmly in his
large Arab stirrups, and clinging to the pommel of his saddle, he
turned his horse&rsquo;s head towards Born&uacute;, and, though
he fainted twice, was soon invigorated by a refreshing breeze,
which opportunely rose with healing on its wings.</p>
<p>But he was really ill when he arrived at K&uacute;k&aacute;wa,
and, unhappily, the rainy season had begun.&nbsp; During the
night of the 3rd of August, the storm converted his sleeping
apartment into a small lake, and his fever was seriously
aggravated.&nbsp; The pools which formed in every nook and corner
of the town were rendered pestiferous by the filth of all kinds
which stagnated in them.&nbsp; He ought to have withdrawn to some
healthier country, but, in order to pay the debts of the
expedition and prepare for new explorations, was compelled to
remain and sell the merchandise which had arrived in his
absence.&nbsp; He made all haste, however, to discharge this
duty; and when, early in September, the Government despatched a
body of the Wel&aacute;d Shin&aacute;n&mdash;Arab mercenaries
whom they had enlisted&mdash;to reconquer the eastern districts
of the province of K&aacute;nem, he attached himself to the
expedition, accompanied by his fellow-traveller, Overweg.</p>
<p>In the course of this new journey they obtained another view
of Lake Tchad, under peculiar circumstances.&nbsp; It was about
seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; Far to their right, a
whole herd of elephants, arranged in almost military array, like
an army of rational beings, slowly proceeded to the water.&nbsp;
In front appeared the males, as was evident from their size, in
<a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>regular
order; at a little distance followed the young ones; in a third
line were the females; and the whole were brought up by five
males of immense size.&nbsp; The latter, though the travellers
were riding along quietly, and at a considerable distance, took
notice of them, and some were seen throwing dust into the air;
but no attempt was made to disturb them.&nbsp; There were
altogether about ninety-six.</p>
<p>Barth and Overweg returned to K&uacute;k&aacute;wa on the 14th
of November, but ten days afterwards they again sallied forth,
accompanying another warlike expedition, which had been ordered
to march against M&aacute;nder&aacute;.&nbsp; It presented,
however, few features of interest or importance.&nbsp; The
indefatigable pioneers were back again in K&uacute;k&aacute;wa on
the 1st of February, 1852, and there they remained until the 1st
of March.&nbsp; Though crippled by want of means, enfeebled by
fever, and beset by a thousand difficulties, Dr. Barth resolved
on continuing his work of exploration, and, on the 17th of March,
entered into Bagirmi, a region never before visited by
Europeans.</p>
<p>Bagirmi forms an extensive table-land, with an inclination
towards the north, and an elevation of 900 to 1000 feet above the
sea-level.&nbsp; It measures about 240 miles from north to south,
and 150 from east to west.&nbsp; In the north lie some scattered
mountain ranges, which separate the two basins of Lake Fittri and
Lake Tchad.&nbsp; The chief products are sorghum, millet,
sesamum, poa, wild rice, haricot beans, water-melons, citron, and
indigo.&nbsp; Very little grain is cultivated.&nbsp; The
population numbers about 1,500,000 souls.</p>
<p>On reaching the broad stream of the Koloko, Dr. Barth found
that he was suspected of treacherous <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>designs against the throne of
Bagirmi, and the boatmen refused to ferry him across, unless he
obtained the Sultan&rsquo;s permission.&nbsp; Resolved not to be
baffled on the threshold of his enterprise, he retraced his steps
for about two miles, then turned to the north-east, and at Mili
succeeded in effecting the passage of the river.&nbsp; The
country through which he advanced was fertile and well
cultivated; village succeeded village in an almost unbroken
series; here and there groups of natives issued from the thick
foliage; numerous herds of cattle were feeding in the rich green
water-meadows, and among them birds of the most beautiful
plumage, and of all descriptions and sizes, sported upon nimble
wing.&nbsp; The gigantic pelican dashed down occasionally from
some neighbouring tree; the marabout stood silent, with head
between its shoulders, like a decrepit old man; the large-sized
azure-feathered &ldquo;d&eacute;degami&rdquo; strutted proudly
along after its prey, the plotus, and extended its long
snake-like neck; and the white ibis searched eagerly for food,
with various species of ducks, and numerous other lesser birds,
in larger or smaller flights.</p>
<p>But an unexpected obstacle arrested his progress; an official
arrived with an intimation that he could not be allowed to
continue his advance without the formal consent of the supreme
authority.&nbsp; He therefore sent forward a messenger with
letters to the capital, and retraced his steps to Mili, to await
his return.&nbsp; He had not long to wait.&nbsp; The messenger
made his appearance on the following day, bearing a document with
a large black seal, which directed him to proceed to
B&uacute;gom&aacute;n, a place higher up the river, until an
answer could be obtained from the Sultan, who was <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>then absent
on a campaign in G&oacute;gomi.&nbsp; But on his arrival at
B&uacute;gom&aacute;n, the governor refused to receive him, and
the unfortunate traveller was glad to find a resting-place at
B&aacute;kad&aacute;.&nbsp; There he had time and opportunity to
meditate on the vast numbers of destructive worms and ants which
afflicted the land of Bagirmi; especially a terrible large black
worm, as long as, but much bigger than, the largest of European
grubs, which, in its millions, consumes an immense proportion of
the produce of the natives.&nbsp; There is also an injurious
beetle, yellow as to colour, and half an inch as to length; but
the people of Bagirmi take their revenge upon this destroyer by
eating him as soon as he has grown fat at their expense.&nbsp; As
for the ants, both black and white, they are always and
everywhere a scourge and a calamity.&nbsp; Of the termites, or
so-called white ants, which, by the way, are not really ants, Dr.
Barth had unpleasant experience.&nbsp; As early as the second day
of his sojourn at B&aacute;kad&aacute;, he observed that they
were threatening his couch, which he had spread on a mat of the
thickest reeds, with total destruction.&nbsp; To circumvent their
devices, he elevated it upon three large poles; but in two
days&rsquo; time they had not only raised their entrenchments
along the poles to the very top, but had eaten through mat and
carpet, and accomplished much general depredation.</p>
<p>No reply arriving from the Sultan, Barth not unnaturally lost
patience, and decided on quitting the inhospitable Bagirmi, and
returning to K&uacute;k&aacute;wa.&nbsp; But he was closely
watched; and on arriving at Mili, was arrested by order of the
governor, who took possession of his arms, his baggage, his
watch, his papers, his <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>compass, and his horse, and placed
him in charge of a couple of sentinels.&nbsp; Happily, while at
B&aacute;kad&aacute; he had made a powerful friend, who, making
his appearance at Mili, interfered on his behalf, obtained the
restoration of his property, and conducted him in person to
M&aacute;sen&aacute;, the capital.&nbsp; There he was lodged in a
clay house standing in an open courtyard, which was likewise
fenced by a low clay wall.&nbsp; The house contained an airy
front room, which he found very comfortable, and four small
chambers at the back, useful for stowing away luggage and
provisions.</p>
<p>M&aacute;sen&aacute; occupies a considerable area, the
circumference of which measures about seven miles; but only about
half this space is inhabited, the principal quarter being formed
in the midst of the town on the north and west of the
Sultan&rsquo;s palace, while a few detached quarters and isolated
yards lie straggling about as outposts.&nbsp; Its most
distinctive feature is a deep trough-like bottom, running from
east to west, which in the rainy season is filled with water, in
the summer with verdure of the greatest luxuriance.&nbsp; To the
south of this hollow, or bed&aacute;, lies the principal quarter,
which, however, is by no means thickly inhabited.&nbsp; In the
centre stands the palace; which is simply an irregular cluster of
clay buildings and huts, surrounded by a wall of baked
bricks.&nbsp; Generally speaking, the appearance of the town was
one of decay and dilapidation; yet, as all the open grounds were
enlivened with fresh green pasture, it was not deficient in a
certain charm.&nbsp; There are no signs of industrial
activity.&nbsp; The market-place is rather small, and without a
single stall or shed.&nbsp; The chief feature of interest is the
bed&aacute;, which is bordered on the <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>south-west by picturesque groups of
d&uacute;m-palms and other trees of fine foliage; while at the
western end, as well as on the south-east, spreads a large tract
of market-gardens.</p>
<p>In general, the houses are well built, and the thatched roofs
are formed with care, and even with neatness; but the clay is not
of a good kind for building, and the clay houses afford so little
security from the rains, that most persons prefer to reside
during that part of the year in huts of straw and reed.</p>
<p>While waiting the Sultan&rsquo;s arrival, Dr. Barth&rsquo;s
time was chiefly occupied in defending himself against the
attacks of the large black ant (<i>Termes mordax</i>).&nbsp; One
day, in particular, he maintained a long and desperate encounter
with a host of these voracious little insects.&nbsp; In a thick
unbroken column, about an inch broad, they had marched over the
wall of the courtyard, and entering the hall where he abode both
day and night, advanced right upon the store-room.&nbsp; But his
couch being in their way, they immediately assailed his own
person, and compelled him to decamp.&nbsp; Assisted by his
servants, he then fell upon the bandits, killing all the
stragglers and foragers, and burning the main body of the army as
it proceeded on its way.&nbsp; But fresh legions arrived on the
scene of war, and it took a struggle of two hours&rsquo; duration
thoroughly to break up their lines, and put them to flight.</p>
<p>The insects seemed to have been attracted by the corn which
Dr. Barth had stored up.&nbsp; But it must be owned that, if
inconvenient in one respect, their attacks are beneficial in
another; for they destroy all kinds of vermin, mice
included.&nbsp; And while they thus act as the &ldquo;scavengers
of the houses,&rdquo; in many parts of <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Negroland
they also render service through their very greediness in
gathering what man would fain appropriate for himself.&nbsp; They
lay in such considerable stores of corn, that the poor natives
frequently dig out their holes in order to gain possession of
their supplies.</p>
<p>It was on the 3rd of July that the Sultan appeared before the
walls of his capital, escorted by about eight hundred
cavalry.&nbsp; At the head of the <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> rode the
lieutenant-governor, surrounded by a troop of cavaliers.&nbsp;
Then came the Barma, followed by a man carrying a spear of
ancient and peculiar shape, designed to represent the
&ldquo;fetish,&rdquo; or idol of K&eacute;nga-Mat&aacute;ya, the
original patrimony of the kings of Bagirmi.&nbsp; Next rode the
F&aacute;cha, or commander-in-chief, who is the second person in
the kingdom; and after him the Sultan himself, attired in a
yellow burnous, and mounted on a grey charger, the points of
which could hardly be seen owing to the amplitude of the
war-trappings that hung about him.&nbsp; Nor was the head of his
rider much more plainly visible, not only on account of the
horsemen gathered round him, but more particularly owing to two
umbrellas&mdash;one of green, the other of red&mdash;borne on
each side of him by a couple of slaves.</p>
<p>Six slaves, their right arms clad in iron, fanned the
magnificent prince with ostrich feathers attached to long poles,
while round about him were gathered a motley array of his
captains and courtiers, gay in burnouses of various colours, or
in shirts of black or blue.&nbsp; Behind them followed the
war-camel, bestridden by the drummer, Kodg&aacute;nga, who made
the echoes resound with the clang of a couple of kettle-drums,
fastened on each side of the animal; and the charivari <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>was swelled
by the exertions of three musicians, two of whom played upon
horns, and the third upon a bugle.&nbsp; Mention must be made of
the long train of the Sultan&rsquo;s female slaves, or
favourites, forty-five in number, all mounted upon horseback, all
dressed from head to foot in black cloth, and all guarded by a
slave on either side.&nbsp; The procession was terminated by a
train of eleven camels, carrying the baggage.</p>
<p>A day or two afterwards, an officer of the Sultan demanded Dr.
Barth&rsquo;s attendance at the palace.&nbsp; He hastened
thither; and being admitted into an inner courtyard, found the
courtiers sitting on either side of a door, which was protected
by screenwork made of very fine reeds.&nbsp; Being desired to sit
down, along with his companions, and ignorant whom he should
address, he asked in a loud voice if the Sultan
&rsquo;Abdel-Kadir were present.&nbsp; A clear voice, from behind
the screen, answered that he was.&nbsp; When fully satisfied that
he was addressing the prince, he proceeded to offer his respects,
and present the compliments of the great and powerful British
Government, which desired to be on terms of unity with so
illustrious a prince.&nbsp; His speech, which he delivered in
Arabic, was translated by an interpreter, and received a
favourable reply.&nbsp; His presents also were accepted with
satisfaction, and the audience ended.&nbsp; Next day he had a
second audience, at which he expressed his desire to return to
K&uacute;k&aacute;wa.&nbsp; After some slight delay, he obtained
the Sultan&rsquo;s leave to depart, and was supplied with a camel
and two horsemen to assist him on his journey.&nbsp; Well pleased
with the result of his visit to M&aacute;sen&aacute;, after the
inauspicious circumstances which had attended its commencement,
he set out on his return to the capital <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>of
Born&uacute;, and arrived there in safety on the 21st of
August.&nbsp; He was glad to find Mr. Overweg in excellent
spirits, for liberal supplies had been forwarded by the British
Government, though looking physically weak and exhausted.&nbsp;
The sheikh received him with great cordiality, and he enjoyed a
degree of comfort and repose to which he had long been a
stranger.</p>
<p>His business, however, was to explore unknown countries, and
to open up new paths to the enterprise of commerce.&nbsp;
Considering it almost impossible to penetrate southward, on
account of the obstacles thrown in his way by the native princes,
he meditated a journey westward in the hope of reaching the
celebrated city of Timb&uacute;ktu, at one time the centre of so
many extravagant legends.&nbsp; The fulfilment of his projects
was delayed by an unhappy calamity.&nbsp; During a short
excursion in the neighbourhood of K&uacute;k&aacute;wa, Mr.
Overweg got wet, caught a chill, and was afterwards seized with a
violent fever, which carried him off in a few hours (September
27th).&nbsp; He died, a martyr to science, and one of the many
victims of African exploration, in his thirtieth year.</p>
<p>A delay of some weeks was the necessary result of this
melancholy event; but Barth, though left alone, was not to be
turned aside from the great object of all his labours.&nbsp; His
gaze was directed towards the Niger&mdash;towards the <i>terra
incognita</i> which lay between the route pursued by the French
traveller, Caill&eacute;, and the region in which Lander and
Major Clapperton had achieved so many important
discoveries.&nbsp; His preparations completed, he took final
leave of K&uacute;k&aacute;wa on the 25th of November; and on the
9th of December had crossed the frontier of H&aacute;usa.&nbsp;
On the 12th <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>he directed his course towards the north-east, and the
mountain region of M&uacute;niyo.&nbsp; The road waved,
serpent-like, through a succession of valleys, the green sides of
which were covered with groves and villages.&nbsp; M&uacute;niyo
takes the form of a wedge, or triangle, the apex projecting
towards the desert.&nbsp; The home of a peaceful and industrious
population, who flourish under a mild and orderly government, it
presents an agreeable contrast to the neighbouring territories,
inhabited by nomads.&nbsp; Its rulers, men of courage and energy,
have not only been able to defend their country against the
attacks of the Babus, but to encroach upon the district of
Digg&eacute;ra, which had submitted to the latter.&nbsp; The
chief of this independent province can bring into the field, it
is said, an army of 1500 horse and 9000 or 10,000 archers; and
his revenue amounts to 30,000,000 kurdi (about &pound;6000) a
year, without counting the tax which he levies on the crops.</p>
<p>Barth diverged somewhat to the westward in order to visit
U&rsquo;shek, the largest corn-producing district in western
Born&uacute;; it is characterized by a curious alternation of
luxuriance and sterility.&nbsp; At the foot of a mountain lies a
barren, desolate tract, on the very threshold of which lies an
undulating country, bright with date-palms and tamarisks, with
crystal pools and rich grasses.&nbsp; Around the town of
U&rsquo;shek spreads a glittering girdle of corn-fields,
onion-beds, cotton-fields, in various stages of
development.&nbsp; Here the labourer is breaking up the clods and
irrigating the soil; there, his neighbour is weeding out his
blooming crops.&nbsp; The vegetation everywhere is
abundant.&nbsp; The accumulation of refuse prevents you, <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>however,
from gaining a general view of the village, which lurks in the
sheltering folds of the soil; but the main group of houses
surrounds the foot of an eminence, crowned by the habitation of
the chief.&nbsp; Observe that while the huts are made of reeds
and the stems of millet, the towers in which the grain is pounded
are constructed of clay, and ten feet in height.</p>
<p>Beyond U&rsquo;shek stretches a sandy table-land, waving with
a dense growth of reeds, and intersected by fertile
valleys.&nbsp; Then comes a spur of the mountain-range which
rises in the south-west; an irregular and broken plain, carpeted
with grass and broom; a jungle of mimosas, dense thickets of
capparis, and at intervals small patches of cultivated
land.&nbsp; The climate is intensely hot; the very soil seems to
burn; and our traveller, feeling himself ill, was forced to
rest.&nbsp; During the night, a cold north-east wind covered him
and his followers with the feathery awns of the pennixtum; and
they rose in the morning in a condition of indescribable
uneasiness.&nbsp; The next night was also cold; but there was no
wind.</p>
<p>At Bad&aacute;muni, the fertile fields are brightened with
springs, which feed a couple of lakes, connected by a
canal.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this channel of intercommunication,
one of these lakes is of fresh water; the other brackish, and
strongly impregnated with natron.&nbsp; It is noticeable that in
this region all the valleys and all the mountain-chains run from
north-east to south-west, and the direction of the two lakes is
the same.&nbsp; Their margin is fringed with papyrus, except that
at the point where the water turns brackish the papyrus is
succeeded by the kumba, the pith of which is edible.&nbsp; Dr.
Barth&rsquo;s two attendants, born on <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>the shores of the Tchad, immediately
recognized this species of reed as growing in a similar manner at
the point where that great inland sea touches the basins of
nature that surround it.&nbsp; It is a curious circumstance that
while the lake of fresh water is of a bright blue, and calm and
smooth as a mirror, the other is green as the sea, and heaves to
and fro in constant commotion, rolling its foamy waves to the
beach, which they strew with marine weeds.</p>
<p>The town of Zindu is protected by a rampart and ditch.&nbsp;
Its aspect is remarkable: a mass of rock rises in the western
quarter; and outside the walls stony ridges run in all
directions, throwing forth a myriad crystal streams, which
fertilize the tobacco-fields, and secure for the immediate
neighbourhood an exceptional fertility.&nbsp; The landscape is
enlivened by frequent clumps of date-palms and by the huts of the
Touaregs, who conduct a brisk trade in salt.&nbsp; To the south
extends an immense piece of ground, utilized, at the time of Dr.
Barth&rsquo;s visit, as a garden of acclimatization.&nbsp; It is
easy, let us say, to define the ground-plan of Zindu, but not to
depict the stir and movement of which it is the centre, limited
as that activity may be, compared with the feverish and
far-reaching life of the industrial centres of Europe.&nbsp;
Zindu has no other manufacture than that of indigo; nevertheless,
its commercial energy is so great that it may justly be termed
&ldquo;the port of the Soudan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Dr. Barth received the welcome supply of a thousand
dollars, which, not to excite suspicion, had been carefully
concealed in a couple of sugar barrels.&nbsp; He was enabled,
therefore, to purchase the articles necessary for barter or gifts
in his expedition to <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Timb&uacute;ktu, such as red, white,
and yellow burnouses, turbans, cloves, cutlery, beads, and
looking-glasses; and on the 30th of January, 1853, he resumed his
march.</p>
<p>The country he had to traverse was the scene of incessant
warfare between the Fulbi and the independent tribes.&nbsp; At
the outset he met with some salt merchants from A&rsquo;ir, whose
picturesque encampments would have delighted an artist&rsquo;s
eye, but did not add to the security of the roads.&nbsp; He
arrived in safety, however, on the 5th of February, at
K&aacute;ts&eacute;na, and took up his quarters in a residence
specially assigned to him.&nbsp; The house was spacious; but so
full of ants, that, having rested himself for an hour on a bank
of clay, he found that the freebooters had climbed the wall,
constructed covered galleries right up to his person, and
delivered a combined attack upon his shirt, in which they had
eaten large holes.</p>
<p>The governor of K&aacute;ts&eacute;na gave our traveller a
courteous reception, and deigned to accept with evident
satisfaction the burnouses, cafton, cup, two loaves of sugar, and
pistol, which Dr. Barth offered him.&nbsp; The pistol gave him so
much pleasure that he asked for a second; and, of course, a
refusal was impossible.&nbsp; Thenceforth he ate and drank and
walked and slept with his two pistols in his belt, and terrified
everybody who approached him by snapping caps in their
face.&nbsp; It happened that, at this time, the ghaladima of
Sikoto, inspector of K&aacute;ts&eacute;na, was in the town
collecting tribute.&nbsp; He was a frank and simple-natured man,
neither very generous nor very intelligent, but of benevolent
disposition and sociable character.&nbsp; Dr. Barth purchased
some silk and cotton stuffs from the <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>looms of Mep&egrave; and
Kan&oacute;, and being very anxious to pursue his journey, waited
for the ghaladima to set out, in order to enjoy the advantage of
his escort.&nbsp; It was on the 21st of March that this high
official, accompanied by our traveller, took his departure.&nbsp;
The governor attended them as far as the limits of his
jurisdiction, and they had a numerous guard; while, as a further
protection against mishaps, they steered to the south, instead of
to the west, in which direction war was raging.</p>
<p>It was the happy time of spring; a bloom was on the earth, and
a light and perfume in the air; nature put on her greenest
attire; the alleluba, the parkia, the cucifera, the bombyx rose
in masses of foliage.&nbsp; The country through which the
travellers rode was fair and fertile, populous and well
cultivated; the pastures echoed with the low of cattle; the
fields rejoiced in profuse crops of yams and tobacco.&nbsp; In
the district of Maja, cotton, indigo, potatoes were grown on a
very large scale.&nbsp; Beyond Kuruy&aacute;, a town of 5000 to
6000 souls, the fertility of the land increased, if such increase
were possible; the many-rooted banyan, or Indian fig-tree,
displayed its colossal splendour:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Irregularly
spread,<br />
Fifty straight columns propped its lofty head;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And many a long depending shoot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeking to
strike its root,<br />
Straight, like a plummet, grew towards the ground;<br />
Some on the lower boughs, which curved their way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixing their bearded fibres, round and round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With many a ring and wild contortion wound;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some to the passing wind, at times, with sway<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of gentle motion
moving;<br />
Others of younger growth, unmoved, were hung<br />
Like stone-drops from the cavern&rsquo;s fretted
height.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>Bassiaparkia, sorghum, and millet were abundant.&nbsp;
But at Kulfi the travellers reached the limit which divides the
Mohammedans from the heathens&mdash;civilization (imperfect and
undeveloped, if you will, but not wholly without a respect for
law and order) and barbarism.&nbsp; As Dr. Barth advanced, he
seemed to pass from spring to winter; cultivation disappeared;
villages ruined and silent bore witness to the desolating work of
war; and it was only by the cattle browsing in the scanty
pastures that he knew the land was not entirely deserted.&nbsp;
At Zekka, a town of some importance, with wall and ditch, he
separated from the ghaladima, and, through a dense forest, pushed
forward to the ruins of Moniya.&nbsp; He had intended to halt
there, but an armed force had encamped at Moniya on the preceding
evening, and he retreated into the shelter of the forest until
the morning.&nbsp; A day&rsquo;s march brought him to Zyrmi, a
considerable town, the governor of which was formerly chief of
the whole province of Zanfara.</p>
<p>On the 31st of March, he stood on the border of the
G&uacute;nd&uacute;mi Desert, of the passage of which Major
Clapperton has left so exciting a narrative.&nbsp; It is passable
only by a forced march.&nbsp; Dr. Barth began by striking too far
to the south, and lost valuable time in the midst of an
impervious jungle.&nbsp; Recovering the direct track, he marched
all that day, all that night, without seeing any sign of human
life, and until the middle of the following day, when he met some
horsemen who had been sent forward to meet him, with vessels of
water.&nbsp; Two miles further, and he could see the village
where the Emir Aliy&uacute; had pitched his camp; he was then at
war with the people of Gober.&nbsp; <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>For thirty hours he and his
followers had marched without a halt; they were completely spent,
and the men, in their absolute weariness, fell prostrate upon the
ground.&nbsp; The intrepid Barth rallied his energies; his
excitement dispelled the sense of fatigue; and he searched his
baggage for some valuable gift to the Emir, who was to depart on
the following day, for upon him and his favour the success of his
enterprise wholly depended.&nbsp; The day glided by, and he had
begun to despair of being admitted to an audience; but in the
evening the Emir sent him an ox, four fat sheep, and four hundred
parcels of rice, and a message to the effect that he awaited his
visit.&nbsp; It must be owned that some of these barbaric
potentates do things right royally!</p>
<p>Dr. Barth entered the august presence.&nbsp; The Emir
immediately seized him by the hand, made him sit down, and
interrupted him when he began to excuse himself for not having
visited Sokot&oacute; before he went to
K&uacute;k&aacute;wa.&nbsp; His two requests, for the
Emir&rsquo;s safe-conduct as far as Timb&uacute;ktu, and a royal
letter guaranteeing the lives and property of Englishmen visiting
his territories, he received very favourably; affirming that his
sole thought was for the welfare of humanity, and, consequently,
he desired to promote the friendly intercourse of all
nations.&nbsp; Next day Barth had another interview, and offered
a second supply of presents.&nbsp; He describes the Emir as a
strongly built man, of average stature, with a round, full, but
not unpleasant face.</p>
<p>On the 4th of April, with the royal letter, of which he had
dictated the terms, and a hundred thousand kurdis which the
prince had generously sent to him <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>to defray his expenses during his
absence, he took up his residence at Vurno, the Emir&rsquo;s
usual abode.&nbsp; The unsavoury condition of the town, which was
traversed by a <i>cloaca</i> more disgusting even than those of
Italy, surprised and shocked him.&nbsp; Outside the walls, the
Gulbi-n-rima formed several basins of stagnant water in the
middle of a plain, where the traveller&rsquo;s camels sadly pined
for pasture.&nbsp; The frontiers of three provinces&mdash;Kebbi,
Adar, and Gober&mdash;meet in this arid plain, which, however,
after the rainy season, wears a completely different aspect.</p>
<p>The town became more and more deserted; daily its notables
departed to join the Emir; though, as a rule, these warriors
cared only for their own pleasure, and would sell their weapons
for a dram of kola-nut wine.&nbsp; In no part of Negroland did
Dr. Barth see less military ardour or more physical
depression.&nbsp; Meanwhile, he amused himself by collecting
topographical details, studying the history of the country, and
making excursions in the neighbourhood; among others to
Sokot&oacute;, on the river Bugga.&nbsp; It was not until the
23rd of April that the Emir returned to his capital, after an
expedition which, if not glorious, had been at least
successful.&nbsp; Always generous towards Dr. Barth, he had
invited him to meet him, and king and traveller went together to
the palace.&nbsp; On the same day, Barth made him a present of a
musical box, which appears to be the prize most eagerly coveted
by African potentates.&nbsp; The Emir, in his rapture, summoned
his grand vizier to see and hear the marvel; but the mysterious
box, affected by the climate and the length of the journey it had
undergone, refused to pour forth its melodious treasures.&nbsp;
However, after a day or two&rsquo;s labour, Dr. <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Barth
succeeded in repairing it, and releasing its imprisoned streams
of music.&nbsp; Who shall describe the Emir&rsquo;s excess of
joy?&nbsp; He proved the sincerity of his gratitude by
immediately giving Dr. Barth a commendatory letter to his nephew,
the chief of Gando, and the long-expected permission to
depart.</p>
<p>Leaving Vurno on the 8th of May, Dr. Barth reached Gando on
the 17th.&nbsp; It was the capital of another Fulbi chief,
scarcely less powerful than the Emir, whose protection was of the
greatest importance to the traveller, because both banks of the
Niger were within his territory.&nbsp; It was not obtained
without persevering effort&mdash;and many gifts, besides frequent
bribes to an Arab consul, who had contrived to make himself
indispensable to the feeble prince.</p>
<p>On the 4th of June our indefatigable explorer entered the deep
valleys of Kebbi, which, in the rainy season, are converted into
extensive rice-fields.&nbsp; At Kombara, the governor hospitably
sent him all the constituents of a first-class Soudanian repast,
from the sheep to the grains of salt and the Dodua cake.&nbsp;
Gaumach&eacute;, formerly a thriving town, is now a village of
slaves.&nbsp; A similarly fatal change has passed over Yara;
formerly rich and industrious, rank weeds now grow in its silent
streets.&nbsp; But life and death lie cheek by jowl in these
fertile regions; and to the ruined towns and deserted villages
immediately succeed prolific rice-fields, shaded by clumps of
trees.</p>
<p>The whole country was overshadowed by the thunder-clouds of
war; yet the traveller passed continuously through plantations of
yams, and cotton, and papyrus, whose fresh green foliage waved
above the walls.&nbsp; He halted at Kola, where the governor
could <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>dispose of seventy matchlocks and the men who handled
them; an important personage in the disturbed condition of the
country, whom it was politic to visit.&nbsp; The sister of this
lord of warriors presented Dr. Barth with a fine fat
goose&mdash;an addition to his dietary which rejoiced him
greatly.&nbsp; As he approached Jogirma, the three sons of its
chief came forth to salute him in their father&rsquo;s
name.&nbsp; It proved to be a much more considerable town than
the traveller had expected, and the palace was a spacious and
even imposing building, in its architecture recalling the
characters of the Gothic style.&nbsp; The population numbered
seven to eight thousand souls, whom civil discord had reduced to
a pitiful extremity.&nbsp; It was with no little difficulty that
Dr. Barth obtained even a supply of millet.</p>
<p>On the 10th he entered a beautiful forest, where the air was
heavy with the sweet odours of flowering trees; but the place is
noted for its insalubrity.&nbsp; Dr. Barth was compelled to
remain there for twenty-four hours, one of his camels having gone
astray; and this circumstance appeared so extraordinary, that the
neighbouring peasants were in the habit of referring to him as
&ldquo;the man who passed a whole day in the deadly
desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a quadrangular eminence, about thirty feet high, in the
valley of Fogha&mdash;an eminence built up of refuse&mdash;stands
a village with some resemblance to the ancient town of
Assyria.&nbsp; The inhabitants extract salt from the black mud
out of which their little hillock rises.&nbsp; There are other
villages of a similar character.&nbsp; The condition of the
population is most wretched; they suffer continually from the
forays of the robbers of Dendina.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>After
a march of two or three miles over a rocky soil, sprinkled with
bushes and brushwood, Dr. Barth, with intense satisfaction,
caught the glimmer of water, as if the sun were lighting up a
broad mirror, and rapidly pushing forward, came, in an
hour&rsquo;s time, to Say, a ferry on the great river of the
Soudan&mdash;the river which has divided with the Nile the
curiosity of geographers, and attracted the enterprise of the
adventurous; the river which, perhaps, surpasses the Nile in its
promise of future commercial industry; the river which we
associate with the names of so many heroic travellers, from Mungo
Park to Cameron,&mdash;the Niger.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>The Niger&mdash;all the various names of which (Joliba, Mayo,
Eghirrau, Isa, Kuara, Baki-a-rua) signify one and the same thing,
<i>the River</i>&mdash;is about seven hundred yards broad at the
Say ferry, and flows from north-north-east to south-south-west
with a velocity of three miles an hour.&nbsp; The left bank has
an elevation of about thirty feet; the right bank is low, and
crowned with a town of considerable size.&nbsp; The traffic is
incessant; Fulbis and Sourays, with their asses and oxen,
continually pass to and fro.&nbsp; The boats in use are
constructed of two hollow trunks of trees, fastened together, and
measure a length of forty feet and a breadth of four feet and a
half.&nbsp; With feelings of a mingled character Dr. Barth
crossed this stately river, the exploration of which has
necessitated the sacrifice of so many noble lives, and entered
the busy town of <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>Say.&nbsp; Its walls form a quadrilateral of fourteen
hundred yards; the houses of the inhabitants, all built of reeds
except the governor&rsquo;s, are scattered in groups over the
area they enclose.&nbsp; In the rainy season, a hollow or valley,
which cuts across it from north to south, is filled with water,
which impedes communication, and renders the place
insalubrious.&nbsp; When the river is flooded, the town is
entirely inundated, and all its inhabitants are compelled to
migrate.&nbsp; The market of Say is not well provided: the supply
of grain is small, of onions <i>nil</i>, of rice <i>nil</i>,
though the soil is well adapted to their cultivation; of cotton,
however, there is always a large quantity; and Say will prove an
important position for Europeans as soon as the great river route
of Western Africa begins to be utilized.</p>
<p>Dr. Barth was told by the governor&mdash;who had the manners
of a Jew, but was evidently born of a slave-mother&mdash;that he
should welcome with joy a European vessel bringing to the town
the many articles its inhabitants needed.&nbsp; He was astonished
to find that the traveller was not a trader; and believing that
only some very powerful motive could induce any man to undertake
such an expedition, he grew alarmed at the possibility of
treacherous and insidious designs, and requested him to leave the
place.&nbsp; Dr. Barth was by no means unwilling, and on the
following day left behind him the Niger, which separates the
explored regions of Negroland from the unexplored, and eagerly
directed his course towards the mysterious zone which stretched
before him.</p>
<p>He had crossed the low swampy island occupied by the town of
Say, and the western branch of the river, <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>at that
season entirely dry, when a great storm of thunder and rain broke
upon him, and his progress was arrested by the rolling clouds of
sand which the wind accumulated in his path.&nbsp; After a halt
of three hours his march was resumed, though the soil was flooded
with water to a depth of several inches.&nbsp; The country
through which he passed had been colonized by the Sourays; it is
a dependency of the province of Guinea, and the natives were at
war both with the colonists and the Fulbi.&nbsp; Thence he
entered a well-cultivated district, where the Fulbi, who regard
the cow as the most useful member of the animal world, breed
large herds of cattle.&nbsp; The scenery was varied by thickets
of mimosas, with here and there a baobab or a tamarisk.&nbsp;
More attractive to the traveller, because more novel, were the
numerous furnaces, six or seven feet high, used for casting
iron.</p>
<p>The ground broke up into great irregularities; ridges of rock
ran in all directions; formations of gneiss and mica schist
predominated, with rare and beautiful varieties of granite.&nbsp;
There, through banks of twenty feet in height, picturesque and
rocky, flowed the deep waters of the Sirba.&nbsp; To effect the
passage, Dr. Barth&rsquo;s followers could obtain only some
bundles of reeds; the chief and all the inhabitants of the
village sitting calmly on the bank, and watching their operations
with lively interest.&nbsp; The men had expressive countenances,
with effeminate features; long plaited hair, which fell upon the
shoulders; a pipe in their mouths; and, for attire, a blue shirt
and wide blue trousers.&nbsp; The women were dumpy and ill
proportioned; they wore numerous collars, and pearls in their
ears; their bosom and legs were naked.</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>Another storm overtook the travellers, and converted
the jungles through which they wound their way into a wide
expanse of water.&nbsp; The solitariness of the land was broken
at one point by a village, charmingly enclosed within a quickset
hedge; fields of maize were succeeded by a tract of forest; then
they entered a populous district, where the loaded camels
laboured heavily through the clayey soil.&nbsp; At Sibba, where
the governor, standing at the gate, was explaining to his people
certain verses of the Koran, Dr. Barth was handsomely lodged in a
hut newly built, with walls excellently polished, and quite an
attractive and refreshing appearance.&nbsp; But, in life, there
is always a flavour of wormwood in the cup of joy; appearances
are proverbially deceitful; and Dr. Barth&rsquo;s beautiful abode
proved to be a nest of ants, which committed wholesale
depredations on his baggage.</p>
<p>The day after his arrival chanced to be the last of the great
Mohammedan feast of the Ramadan.&nbsp; That it was to be a day of
festival was announced at earliest dawn by the sound of merry
music; the Fulbi streamed forth from their houses, clad in white
chemises, as a sign of the white purity of their faith; and the
governor paraded through the town at the head of a
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i> of forty horsemen.&nbsp; As the cadi showed
an inclination to represent Dr. Barth in the unwelcome capacity
of a sorcerer, he deemed it prudent to distribute a largess among
the people of the procession.</p>
<p>He arrived at Dor&eacute;, the chief town of Libtako, on the
12th of July.&nbsp; The soil is dry, and troops of gazelles
frolic about the arid plain which borders on <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>the
market-place.&nbsp; The market, on the occasion of Dr.
Barth&rsquo;s visit, was frequented by four or five hundred
persons, who were buying or selling salt, and cotton stuffs, and
copper vessels, and corn, and kola-nuts, and asses.&nbsp; The
inhabitants of Dor&eacute; are partial to ornaments made of
copper; and Dr. Barth noticed two young girls wearing in their
hair a copper device of a horseman, sword in hand and pipe in
mouth.&nbsp; The pipe, be it observed, is in great request among
the Sourays, who seem to be of the opinion of Lord Lytton, that
&ldquo;he who doth not smoke hath either known no great griefs,
or refused himself the softest consolation, next to that which
comes from heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beyond Dor&eacute; the country was a network of rivers and
morasses.&nbsp; Buffaloes were exceedingly numerous.&nbsp; A
venomous fly, very rare to the east of the Soudan, seriously
annoyed Dr. Barth&rsquo;s cattle.&nbsp; It was the wet season;
rain descended perpetually, as if the floodgates of heaven had
been opened, and water was everywhere&mdash;in front, in rear, on
either side; water, water, water!&nbsp; For quiet English
gentlemen, living at home at ease, or occasionally indulging in a
railway journey of a few hundred miles, in a comfortable
carriage, through fields well cultivated and well drained, where
rivers seldom break their bounds, or if they do, never accomplish
greater injury than the overflowing of a green meadow or two, it
is almost impossible to conceive the difficulty, and even danger,
of traversing the African plains in the rainy season, of
conveying heavy baggage through leagues upon leagues of swamps,
which the unloaded camel finds it laborious to cross.&nbsp; More
than once Dr. Barth was afraid that his horse, in spite of its
robust vigour, <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>would fail to extricate its limbs from the deep mud,
and sink with its rider in the slough.&nbsp; So tremendous are
the rains, that in a single night they have been known to sweep
away the fourth part of a large village, and in one house eleven
goats have perished.</p>
<p>Hitherto Dr. Barth had maintained his quality as a Christian;
but on entering Dalla, a province belonging to the fanatical
chief of Masina, who would never have permitted &ldquo;an
infidel&rdquo; to traverse his territories, Dr. Barth thought it
advisable to assume the character of an Arab.&nbsp; But a dispute
which he had with his host, respecting a pack of dogs that showed
a decided unwillingness to give place to a stranger, indicated no
great religious fervour on the part of the population.&nbsp; Good
Mohammedans have no liking for the canine race.&nbsp; The Fulbi
will not employ them even as guides for their cattle, which they
direct by the voice.&nbsp; All the dogs were black; the poultry
were black and white.&nbsp; Dr. Barth observed that the crops
suffered greatly from the ravages of a large black worm, which he
had not met with since his expedition into Bagirmi.</p>
<p>On the 5th of August he entered into a region of swamp and
morass, and he was glad when, to relieve the monotony of the
landscape, he caught sight of the picturesque Souray villages and
the fantastic outline of the chain of the Hombori
mountains.&nbsp; The various forms of this singular range, none
of the peaks of which rise more than eight hundred feet above the
level of the plain, can hardly be imagined; they irresistibly
attract the traveller&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; On a gentle slope,
composed of masses of rock, is built a perpendicular wall, the
terraced summit of which is <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>inhabited by a native race who have
ever maintained their independence.&nbsp; That these heroic
hillmen sometimes descend from their fastnesses is shown by their
flocks of sheep and crops of millet.&nbsp; Starting from this
point, a twofold range of remarkable crests extends along the
plain, with a curious similitude to the ruins of medi&aelig;val
castles.</p>
<p>Refused admission at Bon&aacute;, and afraid to enter Nuggera,
well known to be a hot-bed of fanaticism, Dr. Barth solicited the
hospitality of some Towaregs, who were encamped in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Their chief, a man of agreeable physiognomy,
with fine features and a fair complexion, placed one of his huts
at the traveller&rsquo;s disposal, and sent him some milk and a
sheep ready cooked.&nbsp; Next day, his tents of canvas figured
in the midst of those of his host, and he was besieged by a
number of very stout ladies, all importunate for gifts.&nbsp; At
Bambara, a considerable agricultural centre, surrounded by the
canals and affluents of the Niger, he resided for several
days.&nbsp; It is situated upon a backwater (mariyet) of the
river, which, at the time of Barth&rsquo;s visit, was almost
dry.&nbsp; In the ordinary course of things, it ought, in three
weeks, to be crowded with boats, going to Timbukt&uacute; by
O&aacute;l&aacute;zo and Sar&aacute;yam&oacute;, and to
Dir&aacute; by Kanima.&nbsp; The prosperity of the town depends,
therefore, on the rains; and as these had not begun, the whole
population, with the Emir at their head, implored the pretended
Arab doctor, whom they chose to regard as a great magician, to
exercise his powers to obtain from the skies a copious
benediction.&nbsp; Dr. Barth eluded the request for a formal
ceremony, but expressed a hope that Heaven would listen to wishes
so <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>very
reasonable.&nbsp; As it happened, there was a slight fall of rain
next day, which drew from the inhabitants the sincerest
gratitude; but, for all that, Dr. Barth was very glad to put some
distance between himself and Bambara.</p>
<p>On the 1st of September, at Sar&aacute;yam&oacute;, Dr. Barth
embarked on one of the branches of the Niger, and sailed towards
Timbukt&uacute;.&nbsp; The stream was about a hundred yards wide,
and so thick with aquatic plants that the voyagers seemed to be
gliding over a prairie.&nbsp; Moreover, in its bed the asses and
horses obtained the chief part of their sustenance.&nbsp; In
about two miles and a half they entered open water, and the
boatmen, whose songs had rung the praises of the Julius
C&aelig;sar of Negroland, the Sultan Mohammed ben Abubakr,
carried them, from winding to winding, between banks clothed with
cucifers, tamarinds, and rich grasses, on which sometimes cattle
were feeding, and sometimes the gazelle.&nbsp; The presence of
alligators was a sign that they approached a broader water, and
the channel suddenly widened to two hundred yards; its banks
alive with pelicans and other water-birds, while men and horses
went to and fro.&nbsp; The curves and bends of the stream
increased, and the banks assumed a more defined and regular
formation; wider and wider became the water-way, until it reached
three hundred and forty yards.&nbsp; Some fires shone out against
the evening shadows.&nbsp; At the bottom of a little creek
clustered a little village.&nbsp; In no part of the course could
any current be discerned; it was a kind of lagoon which the
voyagers were crossing, and sometimes the wave flowed in one
direction, sometimes in another.&nbsp; After two centuries of
war, its shores, once so <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>animated, have sunk into silence;
and Gakovia, Sanyara, and many other villages have ceased to
be.&nbsp; There, on the edge of the bank, towered aloft a clump
of graceful trees, the haunt of numerous bees; here, a patch of
greensward brightened with the colours of many blossoms.&nbsp;
The river now flowed from south-west to north-east, with a noble
expanse of six hundred yards; its majestic flood rolling like a
volume of silver in the moonlight, with the reflection of stars
sparkling thickly on the crests of its waves.</p>
<p>After a pilgrimage of eight months&rsquo; duration, Dr. Barth
arrived at Kabara, the river-port of Timbukt&uacute;; and was
lodged in a house on the highest ground, which contained two
large and several small rooms, and a first floor.&nbsp; The inner
court was occupied by a numerous and varied assortment of sheep,
ducks, pigeons, and poultry.&nbsp; At early dawn, on the day
after his arrival, our traveller, almost suffocated, left his
room; but he had scarcely begun his walk before a Towareg chief
interrupted him, and demanded a present.&nbsp; Receiving a prompt
refusal, he coolly announced that, in his quality as a bandit, he
could do him a good deal of harm.&nbsp; Dr. Barth, in fact, was
<i>hors la loi</i>, and the first wretch who suspected him of
being a Christian might slay him with impunity.&nbsp; He
succeeded, however, in getting rid of the Towareg.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the house was crowded with visitors from
Timbukt&uacute;, some on foot, some on horseback, but all wearing
blue robes, drawn close to the figure by a drapery, with short
breeches and peaked straw hats.&nbsp; All carried lances, while
some had swords and guns; they seated themselves in the
courtyard, overflowed the chambers, staring at one another, and
<a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>asking
each other who this stranger might be.&nbsp; In the course of the
day, Dr. Barth was &ldquo;interviewed&rdquo; by fully two hundred
persons.&nbsp; In the evening, a messenger whom he had despatched
to Timbukt&uacute; returned, accompanied by Sidi Alawat, one of
the Sultan&rsquo;s brothers.&nbsp; Dr. Barth confided to him the
secret of his Christian profession, but added that he was under
the special protection of the sovereign of Stamboul.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, he had no other proof of his assertion than an old
firman dating from his former residence in Egypt; the interview,
however, passed off very agreeably.</p>
<p>On the following day, they crossed the sand-hills in the rear
of Kabara; the yellow barrenness of the country contrasting
vividly with the fertility of the verdurous borders of the
river.&nbsp; It is, indeed, a desert, infested by roving bands of
murderous Towaregs.&nbsp; Such is the well-known insecurity of
the route, that a thicket, situated midway, bears the significant
name of &ldquo;It does not hear&rdquo;&mdash;that is, it is deaf
to the cries of a victim.&nbsp; To the left stands the tree of
Wely-Salah, a mimosa which the natives have covered with rags in
the hope that the saint will replace them by new clothes.&nbsp;
As they drew near Timbukt&uacute;, the sky clouded over, the
atmosphere was full of sand, and the city could scarcely be seen
through the rubbish surrounding it.&nbsp; A deputation of the
inhabitants met Dr. Barth, and bade him welcome.&nbsp; One of
them addressed him in Turkish.&nbsp; He had almost forgotten the
language, which, of course, in his character of a Syrian, he
ought to have known; but he recalled a few words with which to
frame a reply, and then avoided awkward questions by spurring his
horse and <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>entering the city.&nbsp; The streets were so narrow,
that not more than two horsemen could ride abreast; Dr. Barth was
astonished, however, by the two-storied houses, with their
ornamented fa&ccedil;ades.&nbsp; Turning to the west, and passing
in front of the Sultan&rsquo;s palace, he arrived at the house
which had been allotted for his accommodation.</p>
<p>He had attained the goal of his wishes; he had reached
Timbukt&uacute;; but the anxieties and fatigue of his journey had
exhausted him, and he was seized with an attack of fever.&nbsp;
Yet never had he had greater need of his energy and
coolness.&nbsp; A rumour had already got abroad that a Christian
had obtained admission into the city.&nbsp; The Sultan was
absent; and his brother, who had promised his support, was
sulking because he had not received presents enough.&nbsp; On the
following day, however, the fever having left him, Barth received
the visits of some courteous people, and took the air on the
terrace of his lodging, which commanded a view of the city.&nbsp;
To the north could be seen the massive outlines of the great
mosque of Sankora; to the east, the tawny surface of the desert;
to the south, the habitations of the Ghadami merchants; while the
picture gained variety from the presence of straw-roofed huts
among houses built of clay, long rows of narrow winding streets,
and a busy market-place on the slope of the sand-hills.</p>
<p>A day or two later, there were rumours of a meditated attack
upon his residence, but his calm and intrepid aspect baffled
hostile designs.&nbsp; The sheikh&rsquo;s brother made an attempt
to convert him, and defied him to demonstrate the superiority of
his religious principles.&nbsp; With the help of his pupils, he
carried on <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>an animated discussion; but Dr. Barth confuted him, and
by his candour and good sense secured the esteem of the more
intelligent inhabitants.&nbsp; A fresh attack of fever supervened
on the 17th; his weakness increased daily; when, at three
o&rsquo;clock in the morning of the 26th, a blare of instruments
and a din of voices announced the arrival of the sheikh, El
Bakay, and his warm welcome to the stranger dispelled his pains
and filled him with a new vigour.&nbsp; He strongly censured his
brother&rsquo;s ungracious conduct; sent provisions to Barth,
with a recommendation to partake of nothing that did not come
from his palace; and offered him his choice between the various
routes that led to the sea-coast.&nbsp; Could he have foreseen
that he was fated to languish eight months at Timbukt&uacute;,
Dr. Barth thinks that he could not have supported the idea; but,
happily, man never knows the intensity or duration of the
struggle in which he engages, and marches courageously through
the shadows which hide from him the future.</p>
<p>Ahmed El Bakay was tall of stature and well proportioned, with
an open countenance, an intelligent air, and the bearing and
physiognomy of a European.&nbsp; His complexion was almost
black.&nbsp; His costume consisted of a short black tunic, black
pantaloons, and a shawl bound negligently round his head.&nbsp;
Between him and Dr. Barth a cordial understanding was quickly
formed and loyally maintained.&nbsp; He spoke frequently of Major
Laing, the only Christian whom he had ever seen; for, thanks to
the disguise assumed by the French traveller, Caill&eacute;, no
one at Timbukt&uacute; was aware that he had at one time resided
in their city.</p>
<p>Timbukt&uacute; is situated about six miles from the <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>Niger, in
lat. 18&deg; N.&nbsp; Its shape is that of a triangle, the apex
of which is turned towards the desert.&nbsp; Its circuit at the
present time is about three miles and a half; but of old it
extended over a much larger area.&nbsp; It is by no means the
wealthy, powerful, and splendid city which was dreamed of in the
fond imaginations of the early travellers.&nbsp; Its streets are
unpaved, and most of them narrow.&nbsp; There are a thousand
houses clay-built, and, in the northern and north-western
suburbs, some two hundred huts of reeds.&nbsp; No traces exist of
the ancient palace, nor of the Kasba; but the town has three
large and three small mosques, and a chapel.&nbsp; It is divided
into seven quarters, inhabited by a permanent population of
thirty thousand souls, which is increased to thirty-five or forty
thousand from November to January, the epoch of the
caravans.&nbsp; Founded early in the twelfth century by the
Towaregs, on one of their old pasture-grounds, Timbukt&uacute;
belonged to the Souray in the first half of the fourteenth.&nbsp;
Recovered, a century later, by its founders, it was snatched from
them by Sami Ali, who sacked it, then rebuilt it, and drew
thither the merchants of Ghadami.&nbsp; As early as 1373 it is
marked upon the Spanish charts, not only as the entrep&ocirc;t of
the trade in salt and gold, but as the scientific and religious
centre of the Western Soudan; and exciting the cupidity of Mulay
Ahmed, it fell, in 1592, with the empire of the Askias, under the
sway of Marocco.&nbsp; Down to 1826 it remained in the hands of
the Ramas, or Maroccan soldiers settled in the country.&nbsp;
Next came the Fulbi; then the Towaregs, who drove out the Fulbi
in 1844.&nbsp; But this victory, by isolating Timbukt&uacute; on
the border of the river, led to <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>a famine.&nbsp; Through the
intervention of El Bakay, however, a compromise was effected in
1848; the Towaregs recognized the nominal supremacy of the Fulbi,
on condition that they should keep no garrison in the city; the
taxes were to be collected by two cadis, a Souray and a Fulbi;
and the administration, or rather the police, was entrusted to
two Souray magistrates, controlled simultaneously by the Fulbi
and the Towaregs, between whom was divided the religious
authority, represented by the sheikh, a Rama by origin.</p>
<p>Dr. Barth&rsquo;s residence in Timbukt&uacute; was a source of
intense dissatisfaction to some of the ruling spirits.&nbsp; Even
in the sheikh&rsquo;s own family it led to grave dissensions; and
many demanded that he should be expelled.&nbsp; El Bakay remained
firm in his support, and, to protect the life of his visitor,
moved him to Kabara.&nbsp; Dr. Barth speaks in high terms of this
liberal and enlightened man, and of the happiness of his domestic
circle.&nbsp; Europe itself could not produce a more affectionate
father or husband; indeed, Dr. Barth hints that he yielded too
much to the wishes of his august partner.</p>
<p>Week after week, the storms of war and civil discord raged
more and more furious; the traveller&rsquo;s position became
increasingly painful.&nbsp; His bitterest enemies were the
Fulbi.&nbsp; They endeavoured to drag him from the sheikh&rsquo;s
protection by force, and when this failed, had recourse to an
artifice to get him into their power.&nbsp; The Wel&aacute;d
Shinan, who assassinated Major Laing, swore they would kill
him.&nbsp; On the 27th of February, 1854, the chief of the Fulbi
again intimated to the sheikh his request that Barth should be
driven from the country.&nbsp; The sheikh peremptorily <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>refused.&nbsp; Then came a fresh demand, and a fresh
refusal; a prolonged and angry struggle; a situation more and
more intolerable; while commerce suffered and the people were
disquieted by the quarrels of their rulers.&nbsp; So it came to
pass that, on the night of the 17th of March, Sidi Mohammed,
eldest brother of El Bakay, beat the drum, mounted his horse, and
bade Dr. Barth follow him with two of his servants, while the
Towaregs, who supported them, clashed their bucklers together,
and shouted their shrill war-cry.&nbsp; He found the sheikh at
the head of a numerous body of Arabs and Sourays, with some
Fulbi, who were devoted to him.&nbsp; As might be expected, Dr.
Barth begged that he might not be the cause of any bloodshed; and
the sheikh promised the malcontents that he would conduct the
obnoxious Christian beyond the town.&nbsp; He encamped on the
frontier of the Oberay, where everybody suffered terribly from
bad food and insects.</p>
<p>At length, after a residence of thirty-three days on the creek
of Bos&aacute;bango, it was decided that the march should be
begun on the 19th of April.&nbsp; On the 25th, after having
passed through various encampments of Towaregs, they followed the
windings of the Niger, having on their left a well-wooded
country, intersected by marshes, and enlivened by numerous
pintados.&nbsp; Then they fell in with the valiant Wughduga, a
sincere friend of El Bakay, and a magnificent Towareg warrior,
nearly seven feet high, of prodigious strength, and the hero of
deeds of prowess worthy of the most famous knight of the Table
Round.&nbsp; Under his escort Dr. Barth reached Gogo&mdash;in the
fifteenth century the flourishing and famous capital of the
Souray empire, <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>now a small and straggling town with a few hundred
huts.&nbsp; Here he took leave of his kind and generous
protector; and, with an escort of about twenty persons, recrossed
to the right bank of the river, and descended it as far as Say,
where he had passed it the year before.&nbsp; In this journey of
one hundred and fifty leagues, he had seen everywhere the
evidence of great fertility, and a peaceable population, in whose
midst a European might travel in security; speaking to the
people, as he did, of the sources and termination of their great
fostering river&mdash;questions which interest those good negroes
as much, perhaps, as they have perplexed the scientific societies
of Europe, but of which they do not possess the most rudimentary
knowledge.</p>
<p>Arriving at Sokot&oacute; and Vurno in the midst of the rainy
season, Dr. Barth was warmly welcomed by the Emir; but, with
strength exhausted and health broken, he could not profit by his
kindness.</p>
<p>On the 17th of October he arrived at Kan&oacute;, where he had
been long expected; but neither money nor despatches had been
forwarded for him&mdash;no news from Europe had been
received.&nbsp; Yet at Kan&oacute; he had arranged to pay his
servants, discharge his debts, and renew his credits, long since
exhausted.&nbsp; He pledged the little property remaining to him,
including his revolver, until he could obtain the cutlery and
four hundred dollars left at Zindu; but, alas! these had
disappeared during recent intestine commotions.&nbsp; Kan&oacute;
must always be unhealthy for Europeans; and Dr. Barth, in his
enfeebled condition, acutely felt the ill effects of its climatic
conditions.&nbsp; His horses and camels fell ill, and he lost,
among others, the noble <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>animal which for three years had
shared all his fatigues.</p>
<p>Over every difficulty, every obstacle, that splendid energy
which had carried the great explorer to the Niger and
Timbukt&uacute; ultimately prevailed; and on the 24th of November
he set out for K&uacute;k&aacute;wa.&nbsp; In his absence it had
been the theatre of a revolution.&nbsp; A new ruler held the
reins of government, and Dr. Barth was doomed to encounter fresh
embarrassments.&nbsp; It was not until after a delay of four
months that he was able to resume the journey through the
Fezzan.&nbsp; He followed this time the direct route, by
Bilma&mdash;the route formerly taken by the travellers, Denham
and Clapperton.</p>
<p>At the end of August he entered Tripoli, where he spent only
four days.&nbsp; By way of Malta he proceeded to Marseilles; and
thence to Paris; arriving in London on the 6th of September,
1855.</p>
<p>It may be doubted whether the English public have fully
appreciated the labours of this persevering explorer.&nbsp; To us
it seems that he occupies a high place in the very front rank of
African travellers, in virtue not only of the work he did, but of
the courage, perseverance, skill, and energy which he
displayed.&nbsp; He failed in nothing that he undertook, though
his resources were very limited, and the difficulties in his path
of the gravest character.&nbsp; He explored Born&uacute;,
A&rsquo;dam&aacute;wa, and Bagirmi, where no European had ever
before penetrated.&nbsp; He surveyed, over an area of six hundred
miles, the region which lies between Kats&eacute;na and
Timbukt&uacute;, though even to the Arabs it is the least known
portion of the Soudan.&nbsp; He formed friendly relations with
the powerful princes on the <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>banks of the Niger, from
Sokot&oacute; to the famous city which shuts its gates upon the
Christian.&nbsp; Five of his best years he dedicated to this
astonishing enterprise, enduring the gravest privations, and
braving the most pestilential climates, as well as the most
implacable fanaticism.&nbsp; All this he did, without friends,
without companions, without money.&nbsp; Of the five brave men
who undertook this adventurous expedition, he alone returned; and
returned loaded with treasure, with precious materials of all
kinds for the use of the man of science or the
merchant&mdash;with maps, drawings, chronologies, vocabularies,
historical and ethnological notes, itineraries, botanical and
geological data, and meteorological tables.&nbsp; Nothing escaped
his attention; he was not only a traveller and an observer, but a
scientific pioneer.&nbsp; Let us give due honour to a
Livingstone, but let us not forget the debt we owe to a Barth. <a

THOMAS WITLAM ATKINSON,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND HIS ADVENTURES IN SIBERIA</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND CENTRAL ASIA.</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center">A.D. 1849&ndash;55.</p>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Thomas Witlam Atkinson</span> among
recent travellers is not one of the least distinguished.&nbsp; He
ventured into what may be called &ldquo;virgin
country&rdquo;&mdash;a region scarcely known to Europeans;
carrying his life in his hand; animated by the desire of
knowledge rather than the hope of fame; quick to observe,
accurate in his observations, and intelligent in combining them
into a distinct and satisfactory whole.&nbsp; For some years he
lived among the wild races who inhabit Siberia and Mongolia, the
Kirghiz steppes, Chinese Tartary, and the wilder districts of
Central Asia; and he collected a vast amount of curious
information in reference not only to their manners and customs
and mode of life, but to the lands which they call their
own.&nbsp; The broad and irresistible wave of Western
civilization has reached the confines of their vast territories,
before long will pour in upon them, and already is slowly, but
surely, undermining many an ancient landmark.&nbsp; In the course
of another fifty years its advance will <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>have
largely modified their characteristics, and swept away much that
is now the most clearly and picturesquely defined.&nbsp; We need,
therefore, to be grateful to Mr. Atkinson for the record he has
supplied of their present condition; a record which to us is one
of romantic interest, as to the future historian it will be one
of authentic value.</p>
<p>In introducing that record to the reader, he
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Mine has been a tolerably wide field,
extending from Kokhand on the west to the eastern end of the
Baikal, and as far south as the Chinese town of Tchin-si;
including that immense chain Syan-shan, never before seen by any
European; as well as a large portion of the western part of the
Gobi, over which Gonghiz Khan marched his wild hordes; comprising
a distance traversed of about 32,000 versts in carriages, 7100 in
boats, and 20,300 on horseback&mdash;in all, 59,400 versts (about
39,500 miles), in the course of seven years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Neither
the old Venetian, Marco Polo, nor the Jesuit priests, could have
visited these regions, their travels having been far to the
south; even the recent travellers, Hue and Gobet, who visited
&ldquo;the land of grass&rdquo; (the plains to the south of the
great Desert of Gobi), did not penetrate into the country of the
Kalkas.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to premise that in such a
journey, prolonged over so many years, extended into so many
countries, he suffered much both from hunger and thirst, was
exposed to numerous tests of his courage and fortitude, and on
several occasions placed in most critical situations with the
tribes of Central Asia; that he more than once was called upon to
confront an apparently inevitable death.&nbsp; Within the limits
to <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>which
we are confined, it will be impossible for us to attempt a
detailed narrative of his labours, but we shall hope to select
those passages and incidents which will afford a fair idea of
their value and enterprise.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Armed with a passport from the Czar of All the Russias, which
in many a difficult conjuncture proved to its bearer as
all-powerful as Ali Baba&rsquo;s &ldquo;Open Sesame,&rdquo; Mr.
Atkinson left Moscow on the 6th of March, intent upon the
exploration of the wild regions of Siberia.&nbsp; A ten
days&rsquo; journey brought him to Ekaterineburg, the first
Russian town in this direction, across the Asiatic
boundary.&nbsp; Here he took boat on the river Tchoussowaia,
which he descended as far as the pristan, or port, of
Chaitansko&iuml;.&nbsp; Thence he made an excursion to the house
of an hospitable Russian, the director of the Outskinko&iuml;
iron-works, traversing a forest of pines, which deeply impressed
him by its aspect of gloomy grandeur.&nbsp; Resuming his
river-voyage, <a name="citation159"></a><a href="#footnote159"
class="citation">[159]</a> he observed that the valley widened
considerably as he advanced.&nbsp; On the west bank spread a
large extent of meadow-land; on the eastern, the soil was partly
cultivated, and bloomed with young crops of rye.&nbsp; The
pastures shone with fresh <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>strong verdure, were already starred
with flowers, while the birch trees were hourly bursting into
leaf.&nbsp; In this region the change from winter to summer is
magically sudden, like that of a transformation scene.&nbsp; At
night, you see the grass browned by frost, and the trees bare of
buds; in twenty-four hours, the meadows are covered with fresh
greenness, and the woods spread over you a thick canopy of
vigorous foliage.&nbsp; But if you come from a temperate clime,
you miss that sweet and gradual development of bud and bloom, of
leaf and flower, which is the charm and privilege of
spring.&nbsp; You miss the rare pleasure of watching the opening
violet, the first primrose, the early tinge of green upon the
hedgerow and in the coppice, which you recognize as the heralds
and pledges of happy days to come.</p>
<p>At Oslansko&iuml; Mr. Atkinson took his leave of the
Tchoussowaia, and prepared to cross the Ural Mountains.&nbsp; But
while staying at Nijne-Toura, he resolved upon ascending the
great peak of the Katchkanar.&nbsp; The road led through a tract
of deep forest, which spread over high hills, and down into deep
valleys, filled with white vapour, through which the branches of
lightning-stricken pines loomed ghastly like the shivered masts
of a wreck through the ocean mist.&nbsp; Towards noon a
thunder-storm came on, accompanied by heavy rain.&nbsp; Portions
of the forest were so thick as completely to exclude the
daylight; and Mr. Atkinson and his companions frequently found it
necessary to cut their way through the intertangled growth.</p>
<p>Though bears and other beasts of prey frequent these wilds,
Mr. Atkinson met with none; the chief <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>danger was a fall in the midst of
rocks and prostrate trees, which might have been attended with
painful consequences.&nbsp; At last they emerged from the forest
gloom, at the foot of a steep ascent overlaid with huge blocks of
stones.&nbsp; As their horses slowly clambered up the rugged
acclivity, the sound was heard of the roar of water, indicating a
cataract close at hand.&nbsp; It proved to be the outcome of a
small stream, which tumbled down a steep and rocky bed in a
succession of shining falls.&nbsp; Crossing this stream, the
riders pursued their upward course until at eight o&rsquo;clock
they reached the Katchkanar, after a tedious journey of eleven
hours.&nbsp; The guide, a veteran hunter, proposed to halt for
the night at the foot of some high rocks&mdash;a proposition
readily accepted.&nbsp; All hands set to work, and soon a great
fire was blazing, not only for the purpose of warmth, but as a
protection against the clouds of mosquitoes which swarmed around,
and threatened to murder sleep.</p>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Atkinson was up and about.&nbsp;
The dawn was swiftly advancing over the interminable Siberian
forest.&nbsp; Above the vast horizon stretched long lines of pale
yellow clouds, which every minute became more luminous, until
they seemed like so many waves of golden light rolling and
breaking on the far celestial shore.&nbsp; As the sun gradually
rose into the heavens, every mountain-top blazed with fire, like
gigantic altars, and the pines were transformed into columns of
gold.&nbsp; The adventurers were soon afoot, and, crossing a
little grassy valley, began the real ascent.</p>
<p>It was a chaotic mass of loose huge rocks, with snow filling
up many of the cavities; in other places <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>they passed
under colossal blocks, over which it would have been no easy task
to climb.&nbsp; Further up they stretched across large patches of
frozen snow, and reached the foot of the high crags of the
Katchkanar; many of which stand out like huge crystals, not less
than one hundred feet in height, and are composed of regular
courses, with pure magnetic iron ore between their beds, varying
from one inch to four inches thick.&nbsp; In some places cubes or
crystals of iron project from the solid rock, three and four
inches square; and in others the whole mass seems to be of iron,
or some other mineral substance.&nbsp; Climbing one of the
highest pinnacles, Mr. Atkinson enjoyed a glorious prospect, such
as it is difficult for the dweller in plains, with their always
limited horizons, to form even an idea of.&nbsp; For hundreds of
miles the view to the east extended into Siberia, until all
disappeared in fine blue vapour.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is something
truly grand,&rdquo; says Mr. Atkinson, &ldquo;in looking over
these black and apparently interminable forests, in which no
trace of a human habitation, not even a wreath of smoke, can be
seen to assure us that man is there.&nbsp; Turning to the north,
and about one hundred versts distant, Pardinsky Kanem rises out
of the dark forest (this is one of the highest points in the Ural
chain); it is partly covered with snow, and shines like frosted
silver in the bright sun.&nbsp; All the mountains near are blue,
purple, and misty, with a rugged foreground of rocks of great
height, broken into all shapes and forms.&nbsp; In fact, the
summit of the Katchkanar is evidently a mountain in ruins, the
softer parts having been removed or torn away by the hand of
time, leaving the barren portion, or vertebr&aelig; of the
mountain, <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>standing like a huge skeleton, which, seen at a
distance, often assumed the most fantastic and picturesque
shapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a brief rest, Mr. Atkinson and his friends began the
descent of the mountain, taking, however, a circuitous route
which secured them a variety of scenes, and about seven
o&rsquo;clock in the evening they reached the site of their
encampment on the preceding night.&nbsp; There they slept until
dawn, when they made the best of their way back to
Nijne-Toura&mdash;a long day&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>While at Nijne Mr. Atkinson had an opportunity of seeing
something of the pastimes popular among the iron-workers of the
district.&nbsp; It was the occasion of a popular festival, and
the workmen and their families were all holiday-making.&nbsp;
Females and children were riding merrily in the boxes of the
large swings that had been temporarily constructed.&nbsp; The men
were wrestling, just as they might do in Devonshire or
Cornwall.&nbsp; Stripping off his coat, each man tied his long
sash firmly round his waist; this his antagonist gripped with the
right hand, while the left was placed on his shoulder; then the
struggle began.&nbsp; One of the athletes was so conspicuously
superior to the rest in skill and prowess, that at length no one
would respond to his repeated challenges to try a fall.&nbsp;
Assuming the honours of championship, he was on the point of
quitting the arena when a slim-built, but well-proportioned,
young man suddenly stepped forward as a competitor.&nbsp; He was
evidently a stranger, and his appearance was greeted with a good
deal of laughter, in which the champion readily joined.&nbsp; The
latter acted as if assured of an easy victory, but, to the <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>general
surprise, a sharp and prolonged contention ensued.&nbsp; The
wrestler, angry at the prospect of losing his laurels, exerted
all his dexterity to throw his daring opponent, and when that
failed, endeavoured to overcome him by superior strength.&nbsp;
In vain: he was flung prostrate on the ground.&nbsp; Red with
shame, he sprang to his feet and repeated his challenge.&nbsp; A
second combat followed, and the would-be champion, by a second
defeat and a heavy fall, was taught a lesson in modesty, which it
is to be hoped he long remembered.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the young girls, in their best and brightest
costumes, shone like a bed of many-coloured tulips.&nbsp; Some,
with hands clasped together, walked to and fro, singing simple
songs to those plaintive Russian melodies which, in their sweet
minor keys, are often so beautiful.&nbsp; Others joined in a game
which resembles our English see-saw.&nbsp; A plank, about seven
feet long, was placed on a centre block, six inches high.&nbsp;
At each end stood a player, who, by springing up and alighting
again on the board, caused her companion at the other end to rise
higher every time.&nbsp; The players in this way would sometimes
bound as high as three feet or three feet and a half.</p>
<p>From Nijne Mr. Atkinson made several excursions into the
mining districts of the Ural, and afterwards returned to
Ekaterineburg, to complete the preparations for his Siberian
expedition.&nbsp; He took with him a young man, about twenty-four
years old, who spoke German fluently, and bidding adieu to his
friends, started on his journey.&nbsp; In spite of every effort,
he says, a feeling of deep sadness overtook him when his gaze
rested for the last time on the lofty mountain <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>crest which
forms the boundary of Europe.&nbsp; But the die was cast; he gave
the word &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; and away dashed the horses into
Asia.&nbsp; Kamensko&iuml; was the first stage; beyond which he
entered the valley of the Issetz, and rapidly approached the
great monastery of St. Tolometz.&nbsp; It stands on the left bank
of the Issetz, near its junction with the river Teleta, and in
external appearance resembles the Kremlin of Moscow.&nbsp; The
walls are strengthened by towers at the angles, and close to the
east end stands the church, an elegant and a spacious
edifice.&nbsp; The road from this point still lay along the high
bank of the Issetz, which here flows through a well-wooded
country and teeming fields of wheat and rye.&nbsp; There are no
fences in the fields; but every village has its ring-fence of
posts and rails, enclosing an area of from two to three miles in
diameter, with gates on the high-road, and a watchman to open and
shut them.&nbsp; Passing station after station, Atkinson crossed
the Issetz and the Tobol, and struck into the steppes of
Ischim&mdash;a flat, uninteresting tract of country between the
rivers Tobol and Ischim.&nbsp; It is watered by several lakes,
and the small sandy ridges&mdash;they can scarcely be called
hills&mdash;are often covered with pine-woods.</p>
<p>Here he fell in with a large party of convicts, marching,
under a strong guard, into Eastern Siberia.&nbsp; There were
ninety-seven in the gang, the van of which was led by seventeen
men and three women, in chains, destined for Nertchinsk, more
than four thousand versts further.&nbsp; The journey would occupy
them eight months.&nbsp; The others followed in pairs, on their
way to the government of Irkutsk; they had three thousand versts
to travel, or a march of six months.&nbsp; <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Behind them
came telagas <a name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166"
class="citation">[166]</a> with baggage, and eleven women riding;
some of whom were accompanying their husbands into their
miserable exile.&nbsp; In front and on each side rode mounted
Cossacks, who strictly guarded the prisoners; but what were they
to do if they escaped?&nbsp; There was no prospect before them
but death by starvation.</p>
<p>At the various posting-stations barracks are built, the front
buildings of which are occupied by the officers, guards, and
attendants.&nbsp; From each end, to the distance of about forty
or fifty feet, stretches a high stockade, which returns at right
angles, and runs about sixty feet.&nbsp; It is then carried along
the back so as to enclose in all an area of two hundred feet by
sixty; in the middle are the buildings for the prisoners.&nbsp;
The stockade is formed of trunks of trees, twelve inches in
diameter, standing fifteen feet above the ground, and cut to a
sharp point at the top; placed close together, they form a very
strong barrier.&nbsp; The prisoners, moreover, are placed under
continual supervision.&nbsp; They march two days, at a rate of
twenty to twenty-five versts daily, and rest one.&nbsp; A gang
leaves Ekaterineburg every Monday morning.</p>
<p>After leaving Kiansk, which Mr. Atkinson anathematizes as
&ldquo;the worst town in all Siberia,&rdquo; he travelled
directly south, with the view of visiting Lakes Sartian and
Tchany, the remains of a great inland sea.&nbsp; From Lake Tchany
a chain of lakes, some of which are fifty or sixty versts broad,
extends south-west for nearly two hundred and fifty versts.&nbsp;
The country was low and swampy, but rose occasionally in slight
undulations, clothed with long coarse <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>grass, and frequently relieved by
extensive clumps of birch and aspen, or a thick underwood of
bushes.&nbsp; The lakes proved to be surrounded by so dense a
growth of reeds that the water was visible only at a few
points.&nbsp; Beyond, the country was thickly wooded, with large
pieces of cultivated land, on which were fine crops of wheat and
rye growing.&nbsp; The villages were well-built and clean; the
inmates looked comfortable and cleanly; and large herds of cattle
grazed in the village pastures.&nbsp; Speeding onward in his
tarantass, as fast as six horses could carry him, our traveller
crossed the Barabinsky steppe&mdash;a region curiously unlike
that dreariness of monotony, or monotony of dreariness, which is
generally associated with the name.&nbsp; The traveller might
have been excused for thinking himself in some fair district of
England, when he looked around on hills of gentle slope, covered
with noble trees, which formed the boundaries of considerable
plains, and saw the deer nimbly bounding through the fresh green
glades.&nbsp; The view was brightened here and there with
plantations of large timber; at other points rose sheltered belts
of young trees; the effect being in each case so picturesque as
to induce the fancy that art had thus arranged them.&nbsp; The
ground teemed with flowers, as if Proserpine&rsquo;s fertile feet
had consecrated it&mdash;with the bright geranium, pale blue and
deep blue delphinium, white and dark rich crimson dianthus,
peony, and purple crocus.&nbsp; The lakes that studded the
expanse, like silver gems in an emerald setting, bore expanded on
their tremulous wave the blooms of the white and yellow
<i>Nymphoea</i>.&nbsp; The whole scene was exquisitely sweet and
tranquil.</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>But
in Siberia changes are frequent and sudden, and to this Eden bit
quickly succeeded a Slough of Despond.&nbsp; Crossing a morass in
a heavy vehicle, drawn by six or seven horses, is not a pleasant
sensation; happily, the traject was accomplished without
accident.&nbsp; Another and another followed; and through each,
with hard struggling on the part of the horses, and much yelling
on the part of the yemtschick, or driver, the traveller was
carried successfully.&nbsp; He was thankful, however, when the
country again improved, and his road once more lay among the
hills and pastures.&nbsp; At Krontikha, he was greeted with a
noble view of the valley of the Ob, one of the great rivers of
Siberia.&nbsp; From one high ridge to the other, twelve or
fifteen versts is the width of the valley; in the middle, with
constant undulations, first to one side and then to the other,
like a coquette between two suitors, the shining stream pursues
its capricious way, sometimes breaking off into several channels,
divided by green little patches of island.&nbsp; Looking to the
north-east, the traveller discerns, at a distance of one hundred
and fifty versts, Kolyvan, formerly the chief town of the
government&mdash;a rank now assigned to Tomsk, which lies one
hundred and fifty versts further in the same direction.&nbsp; To
the north and east the eye rests on a vast level, dark with the
heavy shadows of forests of pine.</p>
<p>At Barnaoul, the chief town in the mining district of the
Altai, Mr. Atkinson found himself 4527 versts from St.
Petersburg.&nbsp; After a night&rsquo;s rest he resumed his
forward course, and the character of the country soon warned him
that he was approaching the steppes which extend westward to the
banks of the Irtisch.&nbsp; <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>These dreary wildernesses were the
home and haunt of the Kirghiz, before the Russians drove them
across the river, and built a line of forts along its bank from
Omsk to the mouth of the Bouchtarma.&nbsp; The frontier to the
Kirghiz steppe is guarded by a line of barracks; the whole length
of the line (about 2500 versts) stretching far up into the Altai
mountain range, and along the boundary of China.&nbsp; Dull
beyond description is the landscape here.&nbsp; The chief product
is wormwood; and around the fords and watercourses grow only a
few bushes and stunted willows.</p>
<p>Kolyvan Lake lies at the foot of some offshoots of the Altai
chain.&nbsp; The masses of rocks which strew its shores, broken
and fantastic of outline, present all the appearance of a ruined
city.&nbsp; The granite seems to have been forced up in a soft or
liquid state; then to have flowed over and cooled; after which it
has been forced up again and again, with the result that it has
assumed, in hardening, the most extraordinary forms.&nbsp; The
rocks on the heights of the Altai are not less remarkable: some
mock you with the aspect of ruined battlements and feudal keeps;
others might be mistaken for human heads of a size so colossal
that even the magic helmet in &ldquo;The Castle of Otranto&rdquo;
would have been a world too small for them.</p>
<p>It is at Oubinsko&iuml;, a small town or village on the broad,
deep, willow-fringed Ouba, that the ascent of the Altai really
begins.&nbsp; Thence you cross the Oulba, and ascend a valley
full of charming bits for the artist, to the silver mines of
Riddersk.&nbsp; About fifteen versts beyond rises the
snow-crowned height of Ivanoffsky-Belock, the source of the
Gromotooka, or stream of thunder (&ldquo;grom&rdquo;), one of the
wildest rivers in the <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>Altai.&nbsp; With a roar like that
of thunder it hurls its foaming waters down the rugged steep,
frequently tearing off and whirling along with it huge fragments
of rock, and filling the startled air with a din and clang which
are audible for miles.&nbsp; At Riddersk Mr. Atkinson was
compelled to abandon his tarantass; he engaged twenty horses to
accompany him, and an escort of fifteen men, five of whom carried
rifles, while the rest were equipped with axes.&nbsp; A ride of
twenty versts, and he reached Poperetchwaia, the last village in
this part of the Altai.&nbsp; It is occupied by only eighteen
families, who live there in the solitude of the mountain valley,
with the great white peaks around them, ignorant of all the
events that daily help to make up the history of the age into
which they have been born&mdash;ignorant of the intellectual
movements that are agitating the minds and filling the thoughts
of men.&nbsp; A strange, apparently a useless, life!&nbsp; A life
without action, without hope, without purpose!&nbsp; Surely ten
years of our free, busy, progressive English life are preferable
to a hundred years in this lonely Siberian wild.&nbsp; Each
family, we are told, have their horses and cows, and around the
village is pasture sufficient for large herds.&nbsp; The stags on
the mountains are also theirs, and the deer on the hills, and the
fish that teem in the rivers.&nbsp; Wild fruit is plentiful; and
the bees in their hives produce abundance of honey.&nbsp; It is a
Siberian Arcady; but an Arcady without its poetic romance.</p>
<p>The patriarch of the village is described by Mr. Atkinson as a
fine old man, with a head and countenance which would have
furnished an artist with a model for one of the
Evangelists.&nbsp; Health and <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>happiness shone in his face, the
ruddy glow of which was set off by his silver-white beard.&nbsp;
He wore a plain white shirt, hanging over trousers of thin linen,
and fastened round his waist with a red sash; the trousers were
tucked into a pair of boots which reached almost to the
knee.&nbsp; In winter, a wolf or sheep skin coat is added to this
picturesque costume.</p>
<p>In ascending the Altai our traveller plunged into a glorious
forest of cedars, which, with their gnarled and twisted branches,
formed an arched roof almost impervious to the sun.&nbsp; The
scene afterwards changed to a silvery lake, the Keksa, which
slept peacefully in the deep shadows of the mountains.&nbsp; Then
came woods of larch, and pine, and birch, all freshly green, and
breathing a pungent aromatic odour; and grassy glades, fit haunts
for the Oreads of the Greek, or the fairies of the Teutonic
mythology, with high cedar-crowned mountains rising on either
hand.&nbsp; There were no birds; but on the crags stood numerous
graceful stags, watching suspiciously the passage of the
strangers, and from bough to bough the black squirrel leaped in
his mirth.&nbsp; Less pleasant inhabitants were the flies and
mosquitoes, which infested the valley depths and lower
levels.&nbsp; Still continuing to ascend, Mr. Atkinson entered a
rocky gorge that crossed the shoulder of the mountain
ridge.&nbsp; Here the crags presented their most savage
grandeur.&nbsp; Time had hewn them into various imposing forms:
some like turreted battlements and massive towers; others like
enormous buttresses thrown up to support the huge sides of the
mountain.&nbsp; While threading the defile, the travellers were
overtaken by a terrible storm; the wind raged over the heights
and through the ravines with a cruel and sudden <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>fury; the
lightning like blood-streaks wound across the darkened sky; the
thunder broke in peal after peal, which the echoes caught up and
repeated until the air rang as with the din of battle.&nbsp; They
sheltered themselves behind a crag until the tempest was past,
and then began the descent of the other side of the mountain.</p>
<p>Glad were they to find themselves in the more genial lowlands;
and leaving behind them the Chelsoun chain of the Altai, which
they had just crossed, they rode at a rapid rate towards
Zirianovsky, a mining station at the foot of the Eagle
Mountains.&nbsp; The silver mines here are the most valuable in
the Altai.&nbsp; Some of the ores, which are exceedingly rich,
lie at a depth of two hundred and eighty feet; others have been
followed to a depth of four hundred and ninety feet.&nbsp; In
working them the great difficulty to be confronted by the miners
is the vast quantity of water that almost inundates the mines;
but this might be obviated by the employment of a
steam-engine.&nbsp; To carry the ore to the smelting-works
upwards of two hundred horses are employed.&nbsp; First, it is
conveyed in small carts, drawn by one horse, to Werchnayan
pristan, on the Irtisch, a distance of more than one hundred
versts; thence it is sent down the river in boats to
Oust-Kamenogorsk pristan; and from the last place it is removed
again in carts to Barnaoul, Pavlovsky, and other zavods; making a
traject of nine hundred versts in all from the mines to the
smelting-works.</p>
<p>Skirting the base of the Kourt-Choum mountains, which form the
boundary between the Russian and Chinese empires, Mr. Atkinson
turned his face <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>southward, and before long arrived at Little
Narym&mdash;a small outpost of Cossacks, stationed on a plain
within a few versts of the Russian frontier.&nbsp; He was then on
the military road, which extends only about twenty versts
further, to the last outpost from Western Siberia.&nbsp; Having
obtained horses, two telagas, and Cossack drivers, he started
down the valley of the Narym, which opens into that of the
Irtisch, and at nightfall entered Great Narym.&nbsp; To the
officer in command he explained his project of crossing the
Chinese frontier; but was warned that, as winter had already set
in, and the snow lay deep in the Kourt-Chume chain, he would
probably be lost or frozen to death if he attempted that
route.&nbsp; He was advised to go through the Kirghiz steppe; and
the officer courteously offered to forward him from one Cossack
post to another, until he reached the fortress at
Kochbouchta.&nbsp; Mr. Atkinson gladly accepted the offer, and
arranged to meet his new friend in Ust-Kamenogorsk, on the
Irtisch, hiring a boat and men to convey him thither.&nbsp; The
boat consisted of two small canoes lashed together, five feet
apart, with beams placed across, and the whole boarded over so as
to provide a platform, or deck, about fifteen feet by ten.&nbsp;
In the head and stern of each canoe sat a strong, sturdy fellow,
with a small paddle, not much larger than a child&rsquo;s garden
spade; this was used only to guide the bark, its progress being
sufficiently provided for by the rapidity of the current.&nbsp;
Paddling out into the middle of the river, which was more than a
thousand yards broad, the boatmen soon got into the swing of the
current, and the voyage began.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was watching the
changes in the scene,&rdquo; says <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>Mr. Atkinson, &ldquo;as one mountain
peak after another came in view; when suddenly, and without any
previous intimation, two of the men called out that their canoe
was filling fast, and that they must make for the shore without a
minute&rsquo;s delay!&nbsp; Before we got halfway to the bank she
was nearly full of water, and when within about a hundred yards,
the men cried out that she was sinking; this brought our broad
deck down to the water on one side, and helped to float
her.&nbsp; The men paddled with all their might, and at last we
reached a thick bed of reeds, which assisted in keeping us
afloat, till we succeeded in getting near enough to the bank to
throw our luggage ashore; and then we landed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some trouble, Mr. Atkinson was able to hire a good boat,
used for transporting the ore; and the luggage was transferred to
it.&nbsp; Then a new difficulty arose; one of the men
deserted.&nbsp; But with great promptitude Mr. Atkinson seized a
bystander, and kept him prisoner until the deserter was given
up.&nbsp; At last, a fresh start was effected.&nbsp; The sun was
setting; a keen cutting wind blew up the river; and there was no
shelter to be obtained, nor wood for a fire, for many
versts.&nbsp; Fast over the valley crept the cold shades of
night, and swiftly did they steal up the mountain sides.&nbsp; No
signs of any resting-place could be discovered, and the scenery
grew more and more gloomy.&nbsp; Turning a rocky headland, they
beheld at a great distance the glimmer of a fire, though whether
it was in a dwelling, or on the river bank, they could not
determine.&nbsp; Bending vigorously to their oars, the boatmen
shot forward rapidly; and after a long pull arrived at a small
Cossack station, where Mr. Atkinson readily obtained shelter.</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>Asia,
he remarks, is the land for tea; there it is that a man learns to
appreciate the herb at its full and proper value.&nbsp; After
refreshing himself with the popular beverage, he took a long walk
alone on the bank of the Irtisch.&nbsp; The fine, picturesque
scenery was seen with impressive effect under the influence of a
splendid moonlight, which cast the lower mountains into deep
shade, while a silver lustre rested on the snow-crowned peaks,
contrasting vividly with the gloom of the valleys.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How infinitely small,&rdquo; says Mr. Atkinson, &ldquo;the
sight of these mighty masses made me feel, as I wandered on in my
solitary ramble!&nbsp; Excepting myself, I could not see one
living thing&mdash;all was silent as the grave.&nbsp; I had
passed some high rocks that shut out the Cossack post from my
view, and had entered a valley, running up into the mountains,
which lay shrouded in dusky shadow.&nbsp; Two white peaks rose
far into the cold, grey sky; the full light of the moon shining
upon one of them, and aiding much in giving a most solemn
grandeur to the gloomy scene.&nbsp; Fancy began to people this
place with phantoms, ghosts, and goblins of horrible
aspect.&nbsp; It required but the howling of the wolves to give a
seeming reality to the creations of the imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing the mouth of the Bouchtarma, Mr. Atkinson descended
the river to Mount Kamenogorsk.&nbsp; There he found his friend,
the Cossack colonel, who provided him with an escort of two
stalwart Cossacks, armed with sabre, gun, pistol, and long
lance.&nbsp; His party also included an unarmed Cossack driver,
and his own attendant.&nbsp; He set out in a light telaga, drawn
by three horses, and plunged into the solitude <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>of the
Kirghiz steppe, which extends eastward to Nor-Zaisan and
southward to the Tarbogatni Mountains.&nbsp; There are many
undulations on this vast plain, which in summer affords pasturage
for immense herds of horses.&nbsp; While halting on the bank of a
dried-up stream to dine, Mr. Atkinson observed in the distance a
small column of white smoke, which he supposed to proceed from a
Kirghiz aul, or village; but a guide whom he had hired assured
him there were no encampments in that direction, and that the
smoke issued from burning reeds on the shores of Lake
Nor-Zaisan.&nbsp; Thitherward the traveller immediately
proceeded; sometimes over rich pastures, at others over a rough
tract of ground and stones almost bare of vegetation.&nbsp; After
riding a couple of hours, they were able to make out that the
steppe was on fire, and that all the reeds were feeding the
flame; and in due time they came upon a miserable Kirghiz yourt,
or dwelling, inhabited by a dirty Kirghiz woman and four
children, three of whom were very ill.&nbsp; She received the
stranger, however, with simple hospitality, kindled the fire, and
set his kettle on it.&nbsp; In return he made tea for himself and
the children, who were lying on a voilock, covered up with
skins.&nbsp; He then walked to the summit of a neighbouring hill
to gain a view of the burning steppe.&nbsp; The fire was still
about ten versts to the east, but was travelling west, and across
Mr. Atkinson&rsquo;s track, extending in breadth some miles
across the plain&mdash;a great wave of flame, which, accompanied
by rolling clouds of smoke, ran swiftly along the ground,
consuming the long grass, and reddening the horizon with a lurid
glow.</p>
<p>Next morning Mr. Atkinson resumed his journey, <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>passed a
Kirghiz aul, and reached the margin of the Nor-Zaisan, but was
unable to obtain a glimpse of its waters, owing to the dense
masses of tall reeds which completely encircled it.&nbsp; He rode
across to the Irtisch, but there too the view was similarly
blocked up.&nbsp; There was nothing to be done but to return as
quickly as possible to Kochbouchta, and prepare for the
expedition into Chinese Tartary, which he had long had in
contemplation.&nbsp; A man of irrepressible energy and singularly
firm resolution, Mr. Atkinson, when his plans were once formed,
lost no time in carrying them into execution.&nbsp; But while the
necessary arrangements were being made, he found time to
accomplish some short but interesting excursions in the
neighbourhood of Kochbouchta, visiting the gold mines, and
sketching the romantic scenery of the valley of the
Isilksou.&nbsp; At length he was ready for his departure, and
with an escort of three Cossacks, his servant, and his own
Cossack attendant, he once more crossed the Irtisch, and began
his journey across the Kirghiz steppe.&nbsp; All the party were
well armed and well mounted, and Mr. Atkinson felt competent to
encounter, if need be, half a hundred of the nomadic bandits, if
they should attempt to plunder him.&nbsp; His servant, however,
manifested so lively a dread of the robbers of the steppes, and
so strong a disinclination to a close acquaintance with the
Kirghiz, that Mr. Atkinson ordered him back to Ust-Kamenogorsk to
await his return, rightly judging that his fears would render him
an incumbrance and an impediment rather than a useful
auxiliary.</p>
<h3><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>II.</h3>
<p>The tribes of the Kirghiz nation spread over the Asiatic
steppes from the Aral river to the Ala-Tau Mountains.&nbsp; From
time immemorial they have been divided into the Great, the
Middle, and the Little Hordes.&nbsp; The Great Horde occupies the
territory north of the Ala-Tau, extending into China and
Tartary.&nbsp; The Middle Horde inhabits the countries lying
between the Ischim, the Irtisch, Lake Balkash, and Khokand.&nbsp;
The Little, which is by far the most numerous Horde, wanders over
the undulating plains bounded by the Yamba and the Ural, over
Turkistan (now under Russian rule), and into Siberia.&nbsp; As a
whole, the Kirghiz population may be assumed to number about
1,250,000 souls.&nbsp; They are of Turco-Tartaric origin; and,
according to Max M&uuml;ller, Southern Siberia was their mother
country.&nbsp; Nominally, they own the supremacy of the Great
White Czar on the one side, and of the Chinese Emperor on the
other; but their nomadic habits secure their virtual
independence.&nbsp; Each tribe is governed by its sultan or
chief.&nbsp; Quarrels and blood feuds between the different
tribes are of constant occurrence.&nbsp; Many live wholly by
brigandage; swooping down suddenly, under cover of night, on the
richer auls, or villages, they carry off horses, cattle, and
other objects of value, besides men, women, and children, whom
they sell into slavery.&nbsp; These nocturnal raids are called
barantas.</p>
<p>The yourt, or tent, of the Kirghiz bears a close resemblance
to the kibitka of the Kalmucks.&nbsp; One of the better class is
thus described: It was formed of <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>willow trellis-work, put together
with untanned strips of skin, made into compartments which fold
up.&nbsp; It represented a circle of thirty-four feet in
diameter, five feet high to the springing of the dome, and twelve
feet in the centre.&nbsp; This dome is formed of bent rods of
willow, an inch and a quarter in diameter, put into the
mortice-holes of a ring about four feet across, which secures the
top of the dome, admits light, and lets out the smoke.&nbsp; The
lower ends of the willow rods are tied with leathern thongs to
the top of the trellis-work at the sides, which renders it quite
strong and secure.&nbsp; The whole is then covered with large
sheets of voilock, made of wool and camel&rsquo;s hair, fitting
close, so that it is both warm and water-tight.&nbsp; The doorway
is formed of a small aperture in the trellis-work, over which
hangs a piece of voilock, and closes it.&nbsp; In the daytime
this is rolled up and fastened on the roof of the yourt.</p>
<p>The reader will not be surprised to learn that the furniture
and fittings of the yourt are remarkable for their simplicity;
the Kirghiz having none of the ingenuity of a Robinson Crusoe or
the inventiveness of an American backwoodsman.&nbsp; The fire is
kindled on the ground in the centre of the yourt.&nbsp; Directly
opposite to the door, voilocks are spread; on these stand sundry
boxes containing the clothing of the family, pieces of Chinese
silk, tea, dried fruits, and ambas of silver (small squares,
about two inches and a half long, an inch and a half wide, and
three-tenths of an inch thick).&nbsp; Some of the Kirghiz possess
large quantities of these ambas, which are carefully hoarded
up.&nbsp; Above the boxes are bales of Bokharian and Persian
carpets, often of great <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>beauty and value.&nbsp; In another
part of the yourt lies the large sack of koumis, or mare&rsquo;s
milk, completely covered up with voilock to keep it warm and
promote the fermentation.&nbsp; And near this bag stands a large
leathern bottle, sometimes holding four gallons, and frequently
enriched with much ornament; as are the small bottles which the
horseman carries on his saddle.&nbsp; In another place may be
seen the large iron caldron, and the trivet on which it rests
when used for cooking in the yourt.&nbsp; There are usually half
a dozen Chinese wooden bowls, often beautifully painted and
japanned, from which the koumis is drunk; some of them hold three
pints, others are still larger.&nbsp; On entering a Kirghiz yourt
in summer, each guest is presented with one of these Chinese
bowls full of koumis.&nbsp; To return the vessel with any koumis
in it is considered impolite, and the rudeness is one of which a
good Kirghiz is assuredly never guilty.</p>
<p>The saddles are deposited on the bales of carpets.&nbsp; As
the wealthy Kirghiz greatly esteem rich horse trappings, many of
these are beautiful and costly.&nbsp; If of Kirghiz workmanship,
they are decorated with silver inlaid on iron, in chaste
ornamental designs, and are padded with velvet cushions; the
bridles, and other parts of the equipment, are covered with small
iron plates, similarly inlaid.</p>
<p>Leathern thongs, ropes made of camel&rsquo;s hair, common
saddles, saddle-cloths, and leathern tchimbar hang suspended from
the trellis-work.&nbsp; The tchimbar, or trousers, however, are
not infrequently made of black velvet, richly embroidered with
silk, more especially the back elevation; and they are so large
and loose <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>that a Kirghiz, when he rides, can tuck into them the
laps of his three or four khalats.&nbsp; As he ties them round
his waist with a leathern strap, he presents a most grotesque
appearance with the centre part of his person bulging like a
great globe, out of which the very diminutive head and legs
protrude.</p>
<p>The national dress of the Kirghiz is the khalat, a kind of
pelisse, very long and very full, with large sleeves, made of
cashmere or silk, and in the most dazzling colours; but the
poorer nomad substitutes for this state dress a horse-skin
jacket.&nbsp; Breeches fastened below the hips by a girdle of
wool or cashmere, high-heeled madder-coloured boots, and a
fox-skin cap, rising into a cone on the top, and lined inside
with crimson cloth, complete his costume.&nbsp; His weapons are
the spear, gun, and axe.&nbsp; The last is a long formidable
weapon; the iron head is moderately heavy and sharp; the handle,
about four and a half feet long, is secured by a leathern thong
round the wrist.&nbsp; It is often richly inlaid with
silver.&nbsp; The women wear a high calico head-dress, a part of
which falls over the shoulders and covers up the neck; boots of
the same make and colour as the men&rsquo;s, and a long and ample
khalat, with, sometimes, a shawl tied round the waist.</p>
<p>The Kirghiz begin to make koumis in April.&nbsp; The mares are
milked at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning and about the same
time in the evening, into large leathern pails, which are
immediately taken to the yourt, and emptied into the koumis
bag.&nbsp; The latter is five to six feet long, with a leathern
tube, about four inches in diameter, at one corner, through which
the milk is poured into the bag, and the koumis drawn out of
it.&nbsp; <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>A wooden instrument, not unlike a churning-staff, is
introduced into the bag, for the purpose of frequently agitating
the koumis, which is not considered in good condition until after
the lapse of twelve to fourteen days.&nbsp; It is drunk in large
quantities by such of the Kirghiz as are wealthy enough to keep
up a considerable stud of brood mares; and every Kirghiz, rich or
poor, slings his koumis bottle to his saddle in summer, and loses
no opportunity of replenishing it at the different auls he
visits.</p>
<p>In crossing the steppe, Mr. Atkinson fell in with the aul of
Mahomed, a Kirghiz chief, who was reputed to be very
wealthy.&nbsp; Mahomed was a fine robust man, about sixty years
old, stout and square-built, with broad features, a fine flowing
grey beard, a pair of small piercing eyes, and a fairly pleasant
countenance.&nbsp; He wore on his head a closely fitting silk
cap, handsomely embroidered in silver; his dress consisting of a
large robe, or khalat, of pink and yellow striped silk, tied
round the waist with a white shawl.&nbsp; His boots were of
reddish-brown leather, small, with very high heels, causing a
real or apparent difficulty in walking.&nbsp; His wife, much
younger than himself, and probably not more than thirty or
thirty-five years of age, had a broad face, high cheek-bones,
twinkling black bead-like eyes, a small nose, a wide mouth; she
was neither pretty nor prepossessing; but decidedly in want of a
hot bath.&nbsp; Attired in a black kaufa (Chinese satin) khalat,
with a red shawl round the waist; reddish-brown high-heeled
boots, like her husband&rsquo;s; she also wore a rather pointed
white muslin cap, the lappets of which, finely wrought on the
edge with red silk, hung down nearly to her hips.&nbsp; This
couple were rich in the <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>world&rsquo;s goods from a Kirghiz
point of view.&nbsp; Not only was their yourt well stocked with
voilocks and carpets, and richly ornamented weapons, and costly
caparisonings, but they owned an amount of live stock which would
astonish the most opulent English farmer.&nbsp; The noise in and
around the aul was deafening.&nbsp; It was a babel of sounds: the
sharp cry of the camels, the neighing of the horses, the
bellowing of the bulls, the bleating of the sheep and goats, and
the barking of the dogs, all combining in one hideous,
ear-shattering chorus.&nbsp; Mr. Atkinson counted no fewer than
106 camels, including their young; besides more than 2000 horses,
1000 oxen and cows, and 6000 sheep and goats.&nbsp; Yet even
these large totals did not represent all the wealth of the
Kirghiz chief; for he had two other auls, and at each were 1000
horses and numerous cattle.&nbsp; It was a picturesque and
interesting sight to see the women busily milking the cows, and
the men conducting the vast herds to their pastures.&nbsp; The
horses and camels are driven to the greatest distance, as far as
ten and fifteen versts; the oxen come next; the sheep remain
nearest the aul, but still at a distance of five or six
versts.</p>
<p>While Mr. Atkinson was sojourning in Mahomed&rsquo;s aul, a
night attack was made upon it.&nbsp; He was aroused, about two
hours after midnight, by a tremendous noise, which to him,
sleeping on the ground, seemed as if it issued from some
subterranean hollow.&nbsp; At first he thought it was the
rumbling of an earthquake, and immediately sat upright.&nbsp; But
the sound rolled on, drew nearer and nearer; presently it passed,
so that the whole earth shook.&nbsp; Then he knew that the herd
of horses was dashing onward at full <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>gallop; and when he caught the
shrieks of women and the shouts of men, he understood that an
assault had been made upon the aul by robbers.&nbsp; In a moment
he seized his rifle, and sallied forth from the yourt, to behold
the Kirghiz, battle-axe in hand, leap on their horses, and gallop
towards the point of attack.&nbsp; The herds were rushing wildly
round the aul; the Cossacks, with their muskets loaded, were
ready for the fray; all was confusion and disorder.&nbsp;
Presently the sound of horses swiftly approaching could be heard;
they came nearer and nearer; in less than two minutes a dark
troop swept past like a whirlwind at twenty paces distant, making
the air ring with loud, defiant shouts.&nbsp; Five bullets
whistled after them; there was a scream from a horse, but on they
dashed.&nbsp; The Kirghiz followed quickly in pursuit,
accompanied by two of the Cossacks, who had rapidly
mounted.&nbsp; After riding about a verst they came up with the
robbers, to find they were three times their number, and prepared
to fight for their booty.&nbsp; Against such odds no success
could be hoped for, and accordingly the Kirghiz retired to the
aul.&nbsp; When day dawned it was ascertained that this daring
razzia had cost Mahomed a hundred horses.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This was not the only adventure that befell Mr. Atkinson while
he made Mahomed&rsquo;s aul his headquarters.&nbsp; One day, he
was returning from an excursion to some finely coloured porphyry
rocks, when the wind begun to blow across the steppe in strong
and frequent gusts, and his Kirghiz guides announced that a storm
was at hand.&nbsp; Their prediction was confirmed by the clouds
that gathered about <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>the lower peaks of the Altai, and
soon a dense mass of blackness, extending for a long distance
from north to south, rolled rapidly in the direction of the
travellers.&nbsp; Not a tree or a rock offered the slightest
shelter.&nbsp; Spurring their horses briskly, they galloped over
the plain, pursued by the storm, as, in Goethe&rsquo;s ballad,
the father and his doomed child are pursued by the Erl
King.&nbsp; The gusts of wind ceased, and for a short time a
deadly calm prevailed.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the clouds were painfully
agitated, as if by some internal force, and streams of vapour
issuing from their blackness whirled rapidly round.&nbsp; A low
murmur stole through the air; gradually it deepened and
strengthened, until, as the storm broke upon the steppe, it
swelled into a roar like that of a thousand cannon.&nbsp; The
grasses and low bushes were rooted up, and sent flying into the
air with fearful velocity.&nbsp; The terrified horses stopped
suddenly; nor could they be induced to move until the whirlwind
had passed by.&nbsp; Fortunately the travellers had not been
caught in its vortex, and no serious accident occurred.</p>
<p>Leaving the hospitable Mahomed, Mr. Atkinson continued his
explorations of the steppe, and rode onward to the next aul,
which lay to the northward, and was reached in two days&rsquo;
journey.&nbsp; Here, after the usual entertainment, he found
himself free to write up his journal&mdash;much to the
astonishment of his companions, the three R&rsquo;s being unknown
in the steppe to any but the mullahs, or priests, of the various
tribes.&nbsp; The manuscript was a wonder to the children of the
wilderness, and they regarded its owner as a very wealthy mullah,
possessed of the priceless treasure of a book full of
amulets.&nbsp; For the mullah sells his <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>amulets, or
charms, at the rate of a sheep for each scrap of paper, which he
has covered with unmeaning characters.&nbsp; Mr. Atkinson&rsquo;s
ring was examined; also his knife; also a piece of red
sealing-wax.&nbsp; On a piece of thick paper from his sketch-book
he took impressions of his seal, and presented them to the women
of the yourt, who doubtlessly long wore them in their caps as
talismans or ornaments of special value and importance.&nbsp; His
watch was likewise an object of curiosity.&nbsp; He held it to
the ear of a woman sitting near him.&nbsp; Evidently she thought
it was alive and talking, for she communicated the fact to her
companions, and they all expressed a wish to hear it speak.</p>
<p>By way of Mount Kamenogorsk, his old quarters, Mr. Atkinson
proceeded to Barnaoul, which he reached on the 1st of
November.&nbsp; This town is built at the junction of the small
river Barnaulka with the Ob.&nbsp; The streets are wide, laid out
in parallel lines, and intersected by others at right
angles.&nbsp; There are three ugly brick churches, and one large
hospital.&nbsp; Its silver smelting works are on an extensive
scale, producing annually about nine thousand pounds.&nbsp;
Almost all the gold found in Siberia is also smelted here, and
cast into bars; and every year six caravans leave with the
precious metals for St. Petersburg&mdash;four in winter by the
sledge roads, and two in summer.&nbsp; Barnaoul is the centre for
the administration of the mines of the Altai, and the residence
of the Natchalink, or director, as well as of the heads of the
principal departments.</p>
<p>The public museum at Barnaoul contains a very good collection
of minerals, some Siberian antiquities, <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>a few
Siberian animals and birds, and four tiger-skins.&nbsp; The
wearers of these skins were killed in different parts of Siberia;
in two instances their capture proving fatal to some of the
peasants engaged in it, for pea-rifles and hay-forks are scarcely
fit weapons with which to encounter the fiercest of the beasts of
prey.&nbsp; They are seldom found in Siberia; only when driven by
hunger do they cross the Irtisch, and many peasants do not know
them even by name.&nbsp; The last of the Barnaoul company, now
reposing peacefully in a glass case, was discovered, early one
morning, prone on the top of a small hay-rick, near the
village.&nbsp; The peasant, who had come for some hay for his
horses, beheld with surprise and terror the strange and
formidable creature, and shrank from his glaring eyeballs, which
seemed to sparkle with fire.&nbsp; At the same moment the
peasant&rsquo;s dog caught sight of him, and, with a loud bark,
bravely dashed towards the rick.&nbsp; Growling terribly, the
tiger sprung to the ground.&nbsp; The dog met him
intrepidly,&mdash;to be crushed in a moment beneath his heavy
paw.&nbsp; Hastening towards the village, the man gave the alarm,
and quickly returned with a valiant company; some armed with
pea-rifles, others with hay-forks and axes.&nbsp; Several dogs
followed them.&nbsp; On approaching the rick, they were apprised
of the enemy&rsquo;s position by a furious growl.&nbsp; The dogs
made a brilliant charge; but the tiger crouched sullenly, and did
not spring.&nbsp; A small shot through his hide roused him, and
at a bound he was in among the dogs, killing a couple of them
instantly with his terrible paws, and scattering the rest in
ignominious flight.&nbsp; He received two more balls, but they
served only to inflame his fury, and <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>leaping in among his assailants, he
felled one of them to the ground, dead.&nbsp; Again the dogs
charged him, while the peasants with their hay-forks stabbed him
in the back and sides.&nbsp; At last he withdrew slowly towards a
bank covered with brushwood, followed by the dogs and their
masters; but on reaching the bank he halted, faced round, growled
angrily, and prepared for another spring.&nbsp; His enemies
halted, and poured in shot upon him; the dogs barked furiously;
but he held his ground, and could not be induced to move.&nbsp;
After a while, encouraged by his inaction, the dogs began to
close in upon him, and finally it was discovered that a ball had
pierced him in a vital part, and the beast was dead.</p>
<p>The river Ob, which flows past Barnaoul, is described as a
magnificent stream, running in a valley twelve versts broad; its
numerous small branches divide this valley into islands, on which
large trees are growing.&nbsp; In May the melting of the snow
swells the stream into a great flood, which inundates much of the
valley, and gradually widens from one bank to the other, with the
tops of the trees rising above the swirl of waters like
islands.&nbsp; At this time many of the scenes along the Ob are
very grand, especially if seen at sunrise or sunset, when the
various colouring of the luminous sky is mirrored in the mighty
stream, which, flashing with golden and crimson lights, rolls
through the deep purple masses of the forest, to terminate its
course in the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>The neighbourhood seems to be an attractive one for the
sportsman; snipe abound in June and July, blackcock in August,
and rebchicks, or tree partridges, <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>in September.&nbsp; Wild hen are
also plentiful, and in winter, hares.&nbsp; Or if the hunter care
for more venturous sport, he may sally out against the wolves and
bears.</p>
<p>The bears are dangerous antagonists.&nbsp; A very large one
was seen by some woodcutters about fifteen versts from the gold
mine; and two men, one of whom was known as a bold, skilful, and
veteran hunter, started in pursuit.&nbsp; They found the
beast&rsquo;s track quite fresh in the long dewy grass, and
cautiously followed it up, until a low growl warned them of his
presence.&nbsp; He sprang out of a thicket, about thirty-five
paces distant, and confronted his pursuers.&nbsp; The hunter
fired, and his shot told, but not in a vital part.&nbsp; The
wounded animal charged immediately, the other man reserving his
shot until he was within twenty paces.&nbsp; Then, unfortunately,
his rifle missed fire.&nbsp; The bear at once stood on his hind
legs, and sprang forward against his first assailant, striking
him to the earth with a blow that stripped his scalp and turned
it over his face; then, seizing his arm, he began to gnaw and
crush it to the bone, gradually ascending to the shoulder.&nbsp;
The sufferer called to his companion to load and fire; but,
losing heart when he saw his friend so terribly mangled, the
craven took to flight.</p>
<p>Returning to the gold mine, he related what had happened; but
it was then too late to despatch a party in search of the
unfortunate hunter.&nbsp; At daylight next morning, however, they
set out, with the craven as guide.&nbsp; On arriving at the scene
of the affray, no remains of the victim could be found but some
torn clothing and his rifle; and the trampled grass showed that
he had been carried off into the thick covert.&nbsp; The trail
was pursued with the utmost diligence, and <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>at length,
under a heap of branches, in a dense thicket of trees and bushes,
the hunter&rsquo;s body was discovered, and, strange to say,
though grievously mutilated, it still throbbed with life.&nbsp;
With tender care the miserable victim was conveyed to the gold
mine and taken to the hospital, where he was treated with the
utmost kindness, and all was done that medical skill could
do.&nbsp; For a long time he remained unconscious; but at the end
of two months a slight improvement was noticeable, and he
recovered his reason.&nbsp; His first question was about the
bear; his next, about his own defeat.&nbsp; In truth, his
conversation turned only upon these subjects: he seemed possessed
by a monomania; was continually asking for his rifle, that he
might go and kill &ldquo;Michael Ivanitch&rdquo; (the
bear).&nbsp; As his strength returned, it was thought necessary
to place him under restraint, lest his desire to contend with his
fierce and powerful enemy should lead him into some dangerous
enterprise.</p>
<p>But when autumn arrived, and laid its magical finger on the
forest, the monomaniac seemed to have forgotten his hate, so that
he was watched with less rigour.&nbsp; He took advantage of his
comparative freedom to steal from the hospital, gain his own
cottage, and, in the absence of his family, arm himself with his
rifle and axe, and stow away in his wallet a loaf of black
bread.&nbsp; Then, as the shades of evening began to fall, he
started for the forest, and soon disappeared in the gathering
gloom.</p>
<p>As soon as his absence from the hospital was known, a close
search for him was instituted; but in vain.&nbsp; A week passed
by, and it was supposed that he had perished, when one day he
strode into the hospital, <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>carrying on his shoulders the skin
of a huge black bear.&nbsp; Throwing it down, he exclaimed,
&ldquo;I told you I would have him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thenceforward he
rapidly recovered; both his physical and mental health were
re-established, and he lived to bring down many another
&ldquo;Michael Ivanitch&rdquo; with his deadly rifle.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A curious incident befell a Cossack officer in the woods of
Barnaoul.</p>
<p>Alone and unarmed, he was sauntering through the forest
glades, gathering specimen plants, when, at a distance of about
eight versts from the gold mine, he emerged into an open space,
where stood a few isolated trees; and the same moment he
descried, not more than two hundred yards off, a she-bear and her
two cubs gambolling together.&nbsp; She, too, recognized his
presence; and, with a fierce growl, drove her young ones into a
tree as an asylum, and, resolute to defend them, mounted guard at
its foot.</p>
<p>To carry off the cubs as trophies was the Cossack&rsquo;s
resolve, but he wanted a weapon.&nbsp; Retiring into the wood a
few steps, he came to a place where the woodmen had felled
several young birch trees, and from one of these he selected four
feet of a stout, strong, but manageable stem, with which he
returned to the scene of action.&nbsp; At his approach the old
bear resumed her growling, and moved uneasily to and fro in front
of the tree, but carefully keeping within a few feet of it.&nbsp;
He continued his advance.&nbsp; She growled more savagely, and
plainly suspected his hostile intentions.&nbsp; Still he moved
forward, with his eyes steadfastly fixed upon her.&nbsp; When he
was within about fifty paces, she made a fierce rush that would
have put most men <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>to flight.&nbsp; He held his ground, and as the cubs
began to whine, she trotted back towards the tree, in a mood of
uncontrolled rage.&nbsp; The Cossack followed; she turned; the
two antagonists stood face to face at a distance of twenty
yards.</p>
<p>Retreat was now impossible; and there they stood, gazing
keenly on each other, and each waiting for an opportunity to
attack.&nbsp; The bear, with fiery eyeballs, made a second rush,
and at a few paces from her daring enemy, rose on her hind legs,
either to fell him with her heavy paws or crush him in her cruel
embrace; but, with wonderful coolness, he brought down his club
and toppled her over.&nbsp; In a second she sprang to her feet,
and prepared to renew the charge; another tremendous stroke laid
her on the ground.&nbsp; The combat assumed a desperate and
deadly character, and several &ldquo;rounds&rdquo; were
determinedly fought.&nbsp; Eventually, the Cossack&rsquo;s
well-directed blows subdued her courage, and when she could
neither charge him in front nor get in his rear, she fell back
towards the tree, still fighting desperately.&nbsp; Under the
tree a fresh spirit was infused into the affray, and every time
she heard her cubs whine, she returned with increased fury to the
assault.&nbsp; She was received, however, with such a shower of
blows, that, at last dispirited and exhausted, she retreated
hastily towards the forest, and entered its shades; contriving,
nevertheless, whenever the gallant Cossack moved towards the
refuge of her cubs, to make a rush in that direction.</p>
<p>All this time the cubs remained perched among the branches,
and the officer, considering himself victorious, longed to take
possession of his prize.&nbsp; But he could devise no plan of
getting at them, and it was <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>evident they would not come down at
his call.&nbsp; Luckily, a woodman, on his way to the gold mine,
rode into the arena.&nbsp; The Cossack hailed him; ordered him to
dismount, to take from his saddle the zumka, or leather
saddle-bags, and, climbing the tree, to thrust the cubs into
them, while he himself kept watch over the mother bear.&nbsp;
This was done, though not without several sharp encounters
between the she-bear and the officer; and, finally, the peasant
threw his heavy bags across his horse, and led the way to the
ravine, the Cossack covering the rear.&nbsp; In this fashion they
marched into Barnaoul; first, the woodman and his horse, next the
Cossack officer, and behind him the bear.&nbsp; The march
occupied two hours, and the unfortunate mother persevered to the
very last, not abandoning her young ones until their captor had
reached the cottages.&nbsp; Then she hastily returned into the
forest, and was seen no more.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p>There is much to attract and impress in the scenery of the
lakes of the Altai.&nbsp; Lake scenery in a mountainous country
is always picturesque, always striking, from the variety of forms
which it presents, and its endless contrasts of light and shade,
and its magical combinations of colours.&nbsp; Moreover, it
passes so rapidly from the calmly beautiful to the sublime! for
at one moment the silver waters sleep as profoundly as a babe on
its mother&rsquo;s breast; at another, the storm-wind issues from
the savage glen, and lashes them into a white wrath.&nbsp; In the
genial days <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>of summer it shines and sparkles with a peculiar
radiance; a golden glory seems to hang upon the mountain sides,
and a purple light rests on the bosom of the lake.&nbsp; In the
dreary winter, nothing can be grander in its gloom; the hollows
and the glens are heavy with an eery darkness, through which the
white peaks show like sheeted phantoms.&nbsp; In truth, it
appeals to us by its twofold features of the mountain and the
water.&nbsp; The former awakens our awe, lifts us out of our
commonplace lives, and fills us with a sense of the wonder and
mystery of God&rsquo;s work; it is an embodiment of majesty and
power, a noble and sublime architecture, the study of which
awakens the higher and purer impulses of the soul.&nbsp; Beauty
of colour, perfection of form, an endless change in the midst of
what seems to us an everlasting permanency&mdash;all those are
the mountain&rsquo;s; all these belong to that great cathedral of
the earth, with its &ldquo;gates of rock,&rdquo; its
&ldquo;pavements of cloud,&rdquo; its snow-white altars, and its
airy roof, traversed by the stars.&nbsp; Then as to water; has it
not a wonder and a beauty of its own?&nbsp; &ldquo;If we think of
it,&rdquo; says Ruskin, &ldquo;as the source of all the
changefulness and beauty which we have seen in clouds; then as
the instrument by which the earth we have contemplated was
modelled into symmetry, and its crags chiselled into grace; then
as, in the form of snow, it robes the mountains it has made, with
that transcendent light which we could not have conceived if we
had not seen; then as it exists in the foam of the torrent, in
the iris which spans it, in the morning mist which rises from it,
in the deep crystalline peaks which mirror its hanging shore, in
the broad lake and glowing river; finally, <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>in that
which is to all human minds the best emblem of unwearied,
unconquerable power, the wild, various, fantastic, tameless unity
of the sea; what shall we compare to this mighty, this universal
element, for glory and for beauty? or how shall we follow its
eternal changefulness of feeling?&rdquo;&nbsp; Bring the two
together, the water and the mountain, and the landscape attains
its highest character; the picture is then as consummate in its
mingled beauty and grandeur as Nature can make it; and hence it
is, I think, that lake scenery has always such a power over the
imagination.</p>
<p>The Altin-Kool, or Golden Lake, measuring about one hundred
versts in length, and from three to twelve in breadth, lies in an
enormous chasm, with peaks and precipices all around it, some of
them two thousand feet in height, and so perpendicular as to
afford no footing even for a chamois.&nbsp; On the west side of
the lake, the mountain pinnacles rise to 10,500 feet, and on the
south several are even loftier.&nbsp; On the east side their
elevation is less, but still they reach far above the line of
vegetation into the region of perpetual snow.&nbsp; Having
engaged some Kalmucks, or boatmen, Mr. Atkinson and his
companions set out in canoes to explore the lake, beginning on
the east.&nbsp; For the first ten versts the mountains do not
rise very abruptly; they slope to the north, and green cedar
forests cover them to the very summit, while the banks on the
opposite side are almost treeless.&nbsp; Winding round a small
headland, the lake expands into a splendid basin, with
picturesque mountains grouped on either shore.&nbsp; Early in the
evening the voyagers stopped near a torrent, which poured its
foam and din <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>down a narrow gorge, and the Kalmucks recommended it as
a favourable site for an encampment.&nbsp; A bed of clean white
sand, about fifteen feet wide, sloped gradually to the
water-side.&nbsp; Between the upper rim of the sand and the
rocks, large cedars were growing, and under these a bulayan, or
wigwam, was constructed.&nbsp; Though consisting only of a few
bare poles, covered with birch bark, open in front, and the ends
filled up with branches, it was warm, and it kept out the
mosquitoes; and within its welcome covert Mr. Atkinson and his
party contentedly passed the night.</p>
<p>At daybreak, a fresh wind was blowing, and until this subsided
the Kalmucks could not be induced to move.&nbsp; Satisfied at
last with the promise both of sky and mountains, they pushed off,
and doubling round a rocky point, entered a broad and beautiful
bay, curving gracefully in the shadow of snow-capped
mountains.&nbsp; At Tasck-tash, a bold headland, the lake turns
directly south.&nbsp; Climbing to its summit, Mr. Atkinson
enjoyed a noble view of the expanse of shining waters&mdash;one
of those views which rests in the memory for ever, and is at all
times a beauty and a joy.&nbsp; The general character of the
landscape is boldness.&nbsp; Along the west shore the rocks dip
to the east, at a very sharp angle, while upon their foundations
the crags rise perpendicularly, and, above all, a snow-crowned
summit shines like silver against the sapphire sky.&nbsp; On the
east, as already stated, the mountains are less abrupt; but one,
a conspicuous peak, rears a lofty and rounded crest far into the
clouds, with white vaporous billows clinging to its rugged sides,
and the eternal snow whitening its remote crest.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>As
the voyage progressed, the voyagers came upon such mysteries of
colour as filled them with delight.&nbsp; Out of the chinks and
clefts in the deep red granite bloomed bright plants and flowers
with tropical luxuriance.&nbsp; Some slate rocks, grey, purple,
and orange, intervened; the bright yellow of the birches lighted
up the distant rocks; and the background was filled in with the
deep purple mountains.&nbsp; The whole was a wonder of rich
harmonious colouring, like a symphony of Beethoven&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
At another point a gleaming waterfall leaped boldly over a
succession of picturesque rocky terraces, the colours of which
were bright as those of the rainbow, green, yellow, purple, and
glowing red.&nbsp; There was also a white marble, spotted with
purple; another, white, with veins of bluish purple; and a mass
of exquisite, deep plum-coloured jasper.&nbsp; On the third day
of their exploration, the voyagers entered one of the wildest
parts of the lake&mdash;a deep circular recess in the Karakorum
Mountains, into which three streams fling their heedless waters,
uniting near the brink of a mighty precipice, and then tumbling
down from ledge to ledge, to pass through a natural arch and fall
into the lake.&nbsp; Prom the summit of the cliff, where the
water takes its first leap, to the level of the lake, is not less
than two thousand feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Avalanches must sometimes
sweep over this place, and large trees are bent down and stripped
of their branches.&nbsp; Huge rocks are torn up and hurled along,
crushing and grinding everything in their course, as they rush on
into the lake.&nbsp; No man can conceive the chaotic confusion
into which the mass of ice and rocks has been heaped.&nbsp; One
enormous stone, weighing not less than a hundred <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>and fifty
tons, had been placed on its end, on the edge of the rock, in an
overhanging position towards the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Various rivers flow into the Altin-Kool, such as the
Tchoulishman, the Kamga, and the Karbou.&nbsp; They are navigated
by the Kalmucks in light canoes, each constructed from the trunk
of a single tree.&nbsp; The poplar is much used for this purpose;
but, notwithstanding the softness of its wood, the labour of
canoe-building is very great, owing to the rude character of the
tools employed.&nbsp; The sides are cut down to a thickness of
about three-quarters of an inch; but the bottom, which is usually
made flat and without a keel, is nearly double the thickness.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Having completed his circumnavigation of the Altin-Kool, Mr.
Atkinson, with his thirst for new scenes unquenched, started on a
visit to the source of the river Katounaia.&nbsp; His route lay
past Kolyvan, a town where the population is principally employed
in cutting and polishing jasper and porphyry, and across the
river Tchenish.&nbsp; He then crossed into the valley of the
Koksa, and descended upon the Yabagan steppe, where he met with
some Kalmuck auls, and was present at a curious pseudo-religious
ceremony, the offering up of an annual sacrifice to the Kalmuck
deity.&nbsp; A ram was presented by its owner, who desired a
large increase to his herds and flocks.&nbsp; It was handed to an
assistant of the priest, who duly killed it.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the
priest, looking eastward, chanted a prayer, and beat on a large
tambourine to attract the attention of his god, while he
petitioned for multitudes of sheep and cattle.&nbsp; When the ram
<a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>had been
flayed, the skin was hoisted on a pole above the framework of the
bulayan, and placed with its head to the east.&nbsp; The
tambourine was loudly beaten, and the wild chant continued.&nbsp;
Then the flesh was cooked in the large caldron, and all the tribe
partook of the dainty&mdash;&ldquo;there was a sound of revelry
by night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kalmuck priest wears a leather coat, over the laps of
which impend hundreds of strips, with leather tassels on the
breast.&nbsp; He fastens a girdle round his waist; and an
assortment of brass balls on his back, and scraps of iron in
front, produces a continuous jingle.&nbsp; His crimson velvet cap
is ornamented over the forehead with brass beads and glass drops,
and at the back with feathers from the tail of the crane.</p>
<p>The Kalmucks who inhabit these steppes own large herds of
horses and oxen, and flocks of sheep.&nbsp; Some of the men are
sturdy fellows and perfect Nimrods; they live by the chase, and
spend months alone in the mountain wilds.&nbsp; Mr. Atkinson
speaks of them as brave, honest, and faithful.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have slept at their bulayan, and partaken of their venison.&nbsp;
A City alderman would be horrified to see the haunch of a fine
buck cut into small pieces an inch square and half an inch thick,
through twenty of which a sharp-pointed stick is run, and the
thick end stuck into the ground in a leaning position near the
fire.&nbsp; Every man here is his own cook, and attends to the
roast.&nbsp; The upper piece is first done, when it is slipped
off, dipped in salt, and eaten quite hot&mdash;without currant
jelly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Ouemonia Lake, the last village in the Altai, Mr. Atkinson
halted in order to obtain a sufficient number of men and horses
for his ascent to the source of the <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Katounaia, and the Bielouka, the
highest point in the Altai chain.&nbsp; He was provided by the
chief official, or magistrate, with an escort of six Kalmucks and
two Russians (one of them a veteran hunter), and at seven
o&rsquo;clock on Wednesday morning sprang into his saddle and
rode away.&nbsp; Including himself and his attendant, the party
consisted of ten men, with sixteen horses and one dog.&nbsp;
Crossing a little steppe, about six versts long, they entered the
forest belt which surrounds the lower declivities of the
forest-range, and through groves of pine, cedar, birch, and
poplar, began their ascent of the first chain.&nbsp; Emerging
from the thick leafy covert, they came upon the bare
mountain-side, with a storm of rain and sleet beating in their
faces, and pursued their way to the foot of a lofty acclivity,
across which lay their track.&nbsp; Here they rested, in a
&ldquo;cedarn shade,&rdquo; until the gale had subsided: then
<i>en avant</i>!&nbsp; Through masses of fallen granite and
jasper, interspersed with a few giant cedars, they slowly made
their way, until they began in earnest to climb the great steep;
a slow operation and a dangerous, for great crags, hurled from
the upper heights, hung here and there so insecurely as,
apparently, to need but a breath to send them crashing downwards
in an avalanche, and at other places the ledges along which they
rode were so narrow, that the slightest stumble on the part of
their patient horses must have precipitated them into
destruction!&nbsp; A painful ride of two hours brought them to
the summit, which commanded a noble view of the Katounaia valley
and the mountains to the north.</p>
<p>Their ride was continued over a high plateau, on which huge
rocks, rugged and curiously wrought, the <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>remains of
shattered peaks, stood in their awful grandeur; carrying back the
imagination through the dim shadows of the past to a period long
before the present forms of life existed, and speaking eloquently
of the vast changes which earth has undergone.&nbsp; Their aspect
was often that of colossal castles, grim with tower and
battlement, which fancy peopled with the demons of the mountain
and the wilderness.&nbsp; But the travellers could not stay to
study them; signs of a terrible tempest were visible, and they
dashed forward at a hard gallop to seek shelter in the valley of
the Tschugash.&nbsp; A group of cedars, with a patch of smooth
turf, was found on the river bank, and there they
bivouacked.&nbsp; The night passed without accident or adventure;
and early next morning they were again on horseback, and across
ridge and valley, through scenes of the strangest
picturesqueness, pursued their track.&nbsp; Across ridge and
valley, but in a lofty region always&mdash;just below the line of
perpetual snow, but above the region of vegetation; the eye
unrelieved by branch of moss or blade of grass; until, towards
evening, they descended into the valley of the Arriga.&nbsp; Then
they wound over a low wooded ridge, and struck into a rugged
pass, at the head of which they encamped for the night.&nbsp; The
tents were pitched; a huge fire blazed; and the hunter having
shot a very fine deer, a savour of venison speedily perfumed the
cool night air.&nbsp; What with venison and wodky, the travellers
feasted gloriously, and the echoes rang with the wild songs of
the Kalmucks.</p>
<p>The morning came, and with it the signal
&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo;&nbsp; They ascended the bank of the Arriga
to its source&mdash;a small circular basin of about thirty feet
<a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>diameter, at the foot of a precipice seven or eight
hundred feet in height.&nbsp; The basin was deep, with a bed of
white pebbles; the water, clear as crystal, issuing forth in a
copious stream, rolled downward in a series of small and shining
cascades.&nbsp; The path, from this point, lay across a high
mountain, the upper part of which was deep shrouded in snow, and
it toiled up to the summit in about a hundred bends and curves; a
summit like a razor-back, not more than twenty-five feet
wide.&nbsp; The ascent was arduous and perilous, but still worse
the descent on the other side, owing to the exceeding
steepness.&nbsp; Accomplishing it in safety, Mr. Atkinson found
himself in the valley of the Mein.&nbsp; The river rises at the
foot of a precipice which reaches far above the snow line, and
winds its course through a morass which, in the old time, has
been a lake, shut in by a barrier of rocks, except at one narrow
gap, where the little stream finds an exit in a fall of about
fifty feet deep.&nbsp; At the head of the lake is another
cataract, which throws its &ldquo;sheeted silver&rsquo;s
perpendicular&rdquo; down the precipice in one grand leap of full
five hundred feet.</p>
<p>Crossing another chain, and still ascending, the explorers
reached another little lake, the Kara-goll, or &ldquo;Black
Lake,&rdquo; with its waters shining a deep emerald green.&nbsp;
This effect, however, is not produced by any surrounding verdure,
for the lake is almost encompassed by high mountains, and crags
of red and yellowish granite, that rise up into the region of
eternal snow.&nbsp; At the upper end a huge mass of basaltic
rocks, of a deep grey colour, forms a fine contrast to the yellow
castellated forms at their base.&nbsp; On the opposite side of
the lake high precipices of <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>granite are backed by grand mountain
summits, white with the snows of uncounted ages.</p>
<p>Fording the Kara-sou, or &ldquo;black water&rdquo;&mdash;a
stream issuing from the lake&mdash;and crossing a beautiful
valley, the riders entered a thickly wooded region which
stretches over the lower mountain range down to the Katounaia,
and arrived on the bank of the river Bitchuatoo.&nbsp; Thrice had
they changed from summer to winter in the course of a day&rsquo;s
ride.&nbsp; Turning to the south, they ascended a steep and lofty
summit, from which it was supposed the Bielouka would be
visible.&nbsp; It proved to be a rocky height that towered above
all the mountains to the west of the Katounaia, even above the
loftiest crests of the Chelsoun; and vast and magnificent was the
panorama which it commanded.&nbsp; In the foreground, a ridge of
huge granite crags, tinted with mosses of almost every hue.&nbsp;
In all directions rolled chains of snowy peaks, like the
storm-tossed waves of a suddenly frozen sea; and as they rolled,
they gradually ebbed, so to speak, down to the far steppes of
Chinese Tartary, and were lost in a vapour-shrouded horizon.</p>
<p>But the Bielouka was not to be seen, and Mr. Atkinson resumed
his ride, keeping along the crest of the mountain for about two
versts, and then striking into a little valley, watered by
several lakelets.&nbsp; A dreary place!&nbsp; There were neither
shrubs nor trees; and the barrenness of desolation was relieved
only by a few patches of short mossy grass.&nbsp; Sharp edges of
slate, projecting above the surface, showed that the upheaval of
the strata had been effected perpendicularly.&nbsp; To the south
rose &ldquo;half a mountain&rdquo; in a precipice of not less
than 2500 feet above the lakes; while a <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>similarly
strange combination of cliffs faced it on the north.&nbsp;
Between these precipices, at the head of the valley, towered what
might be taken for a colossal dome; beyond which a forest of
white peaks were sharply defined against the blue serene.</p>
<p>The travellers reached the head of the valley, and examined
from a near point the enormous dome.&nbsp; From a distance the
curve on its sides had appeared as regular as if wrought by human
skill; but they now found that it was piled up with huge blocks
of slate and granite, over which it would be impossible to take
the horses.&nbsp; A steep ascent to the north brought them,
however, to its summit.&nbsp; There the scene was sufficiently
remarkable: you might have thought that the Titans had been at
play, with great fragments of slate, granite, jasper, and
porphyry for their counters.&nbsp; The horses and most of the men
were sent round by the base of the cliffs, while Mr. Atkinson,
with his servant and the village-hunter, scrambled through the
chaos to the edge of a vast circular hollow, which proved to be a
vast volcanic crater, not less than nine to twelve hundred feet
in diameter, and fully fifty feet in depth.&nbsp; It was heaped
up with blocks and boulders and fragments of all sizes, from a
cube of twelve inches to a mass weighing half a hundred
tons.&nbsp; It is a belief of the Kalmucks that this gloomy spot
is inhabited by Shaitan, and they regard it with superstitious
dread.&nbsp; Certainly, it is eery enough to be haunted by many a
ghostly legend.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Next day, taking a different track, Mr. Atkinson descended the
valley of the Tourgau, listening to the music of the stream as it
raced over its rocky bed with <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>the speed of a &ldquo;swift
Camilla.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a point where it suddenly swept round
the base of some cliffs of slate, the Kalmuck guide said that it
might be forded, though the passage was very difficult.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We stood on the high bank a few minutes,&rdquo; says Mr.
Atkinson, &ldquo;and surveyed the boiling and rushing water
beneath, while immediately above were a succession of small
falls, varying from six to ten feet in height.&nbsp; At the
bottom of the last there was a rapid, extending about twenty
paces down the river; then came another fall of greater depth;
after which the torrent rushes onward over large stones until it
joins the Katounaia.&nbsp; Across this rapid, between the falls,
we had to make our passage&mdash;not one at a time, but five
abreast, otherwise we should be swept away.&nbsp; As we could
only descend the rocky bank in single file, and scarcely find
room at the bottom for our horses to stand upon, it was no easy
matter to form our party before plunging into the foaming
water.&nbsp; Zepta was the first to descend; I followed; then
came three others, with two led horses.&nbsp; To go straight
across was impossible; we could only land on some shelving rocks
a few paces above the lower fall.&nbsp; The brave Zepta gave the
word, and we rode into the rushing waters, knee to knee.&nbsp;
Our horses walked slowly and steadily on, as the water dashed up
their sides; instinct making them aware of the danger, they kept
their heads straight across the stream.&nbsp; The distance we
forded was not more than twenty paces, but we were at least five
minutes doing it; and it was with no small satisfaction that we
found ourselves standing on the rocks, some twenty feet above the
water, wishing as safe a passage to our friends.&nbsp; When I saw
them <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>drawn up on the little bank, and then dash into the
stream, I felt the danger of their position more than when
crossing myself.&nbsp; Their horses breasted the torrent bravely,
and all were safely landed; the dog was placed on one of the
pack-horses, where he lay between the bags in perfect
security.&nbsp; I am certain that every man felt a relief when
the enterprise was accomplished, which would have been impossible
had the water been three inches deeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Continuing their ride down the valley, in about ten hours the
party reached the river Katounaia and the grassy valley through
which it foams and flows.&nbsp; Their route lay up its banks, and
speedily brought them to the broad swift stream of the Tourgau,
which reflects in its water groups of cedars and birches, with
rows of tall poplars decked in foliage of the richest
colours.&nbsp; Fording the Tourgau, they soon afterwards came
again upon the Katounaia, and crossing it, reached a bend in the
valley, which presented to them the monarch of the Altai chain,
the magnificent Bielouka.&nbsp; Its stupendous mass uplifts two
enormous peaks, buttressed by huge rocks, which enclose a number
of valleys or ravines filled with glaciers; these roll their
frozen floods to the brink of the imposing precipices which
overhang the valley of the Katounaia.</p>
<p>Mr. Atkinson determined on attempting the ascent of this regal
height.&nbsp; It was a bright morning when he started, and the
two white peaks shone grandly in the early sunshine, which
gradually dipped down into the valley, and with its fringes of
gold touched the sombre cedars.&nbsp; An hour&rsquo;s ride
carried him and his followers to the bifurcation of the
Katounaia, and <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>then they ascended the north-eastern arm, which rises
among the glaciers of the Bielouka.&nbsp; When they had got
beyond the last tree that struggled up the mountain&rsquo;s side,
they dismounted; and Mr. Atkinson, with the hunter, Zepta, and
three Kalmucks, pressed forward on foot, leaving the others in
charge of the horses.&nbsp; At first they clambered over the
ruins of a mighty avalanche, which in the preceding summer had
cloven its way down the precipices, until they reached the
glacier, stretching far up the mountain, whence wells the
Katounaia in two little ice-cold, transparent streams.&nbsp;
There they halted for their mid-day meal.&nbsp; Turning to the
west, they toiled up a terrific gorge, filled with fallen rocks
and ice, and then climbed a rugged acclivity that, like an
inclined plane, reached to the very base of one of the peaks of
the Bielouka.&nbsp; Step after step they wearily but persistently
ascended, until they reached the frozen snow, scaling which for
about three hundred paces they reached the base of the peak,
already at such a height as to overlook every summit of the
Altai.&nbsp; Far away to the west the vast steppes of the Kirghiz
were lost in the blue distance.&nbsp; To the west many a
mountain-ridge descended towards the steppes on the east of
Nor-Zaisan, and to the Desert of Gobi.&nbsp; The shimmer of a
lake was visible at several points; while innumerable rivers,
like threads of silver, traced their fantastic broidery through
the dark green valleys.</p>
<p>About a hundred paces further, the adventurers found
themselves at the head of another glacier, which stretched
westward through a deep ravine.&nbsp; Beyond it lay the great
hollow between the two <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>peaks.&nbsp; This, in Mr.
Atkinson&rsquo;s opinion, it was possible for them to reach,
though they could not hope to ascend either peak.&nbsp; They are
cones, he says, from eight hundred to a thousand feet high,
covered with hard frozen snow, with a few points of the green
slate jutting through.&nbsp; We imagine, however, that to a
member of the Alpine Club, to any one who has conquered the
Matterhorn or the Jungfrau, they would offer no insuperable
difficulties.</p>
<p>Mr. Atkinson retraced his steps in safety, gained the spot
where the Kalmucks were waiting with the horses, and rode rapidly
towards the place which he had selected for a camp.&nbsp; Next
morning he proceeded to cross the mountains by a new route to the
mouth of the river Koksa; it proved to be the most arduous of his
many enterprises.&nbsp; Hour after hour, his Kalmuck guide led
him through a wilderness of rocks and sand, and he rejoiced
greatly when at last they descended towards the wooded region,
and caught sight of the dark Katounaia winding in a deep valley
three thousand feet below.&nbsp; They followed downwards a track
made by animals, but, though easy for stags and deer, it was
difficult for horses.&nbsp; In many places the only traject was a
narrow ledge, with deep precipices beneath, and often steep,
rugged acclivities above.&nbsp; In one place they had to ride
over what the Kalmucks call a &ldquo;Bomb&rdquo;&mdash;a narrow
ridge of rocks, passable only by one horse at a time.&nbsp;
Should two persons meet on any part of these &ldquo;Bombs,&rdquo;
one of the horses must be thrown over, as it is as impossible to
turn round as to pass.&nbsp; On reaching the track by which the
Kalmuck hunters ascend the mountains, Zepta called a halt, and
sent one of his companions <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>on foot to the other end of the
fearful ridge, hidden from view by some high crags, round which
the party had to ride.&nbsp; In less than half an hour he
returned, but without his cap, which had been left as a signal to
any hunters who might follow, that travellers were crossing the
&ldquo;Bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now we shall allow Mr. Atkinson to speak
himself:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zepta and the hunter told me to drop the reins on my
horse&rsquo;s neck, and he would go over with perfect
safety.&nbsp; The former led the van; I followed, as desired, at
three or four paces behind him.&nbsp; For the first twenty yards
the sensation was not agreeable.&nbsp; After that I felt perfect
confidence in the animal, and was sure, if left to himself, he
would carry me safely over.&nbsp; The whole distance was about
five hundred paces, and occupied about a quarter of an hour in
crossing.&nbsp; In some places it was fearful to look
down&mdash;on one side the rocks were nearly perpendicular for
five or six hundred feet; and on the other, so steep, that no man
could stand upon them.&nbsp; When over, I turned round and
watched the others thread their way across; it was truly terrific
to look at them on the narrow and stony path&mdash;one false
step, and both horse and rider must be hurled into the valley a
thousand feet below!&nbsp; These are the perils over which the
daring sable-hunters often ride.&nbsp; With them it is a
necessity; they risk it to obtain food, and not for bravado, or
from foolhardy recklessness&mdash;like that of some men who ride
their horses up and down a staircase.&nbsp; Kalmuck and Kirghiz
would laugh at such feats.&nbsp; I have seen men who would ride
their horses along the roof of the highest cathedral in Europe,
if a plank, eighteen <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>inches wide, were secured along the
ridge.&nbsp; Nor would they require a great wager to induce them
to do it; theirs is a continual life of danger and hardships; and
they never seek it unnecessarily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This ridge carried them across the valley, and they descended
through a dense cedar forest to the bank of the river, where they
supped splendidly on a fine fat buck that had fallen to the guns
of Zepta and Mr. Atkinson.&nbsp; Next morning, they were again in
the saddle <i>en route</i> for Ouemonia, where their safe return
excited much popular enthusiasm.&nbsp; Bidding adieu to his
faithful companions, he crossed the Katounaia, and with a new
escort rode on towards the Koksa.&nbsp; Leaving it to the south,
he struck the river Tschugash, encamped for the night in a clump
of pines on its bank, and in a day or two arrived at his old
quarters on the Tchenish.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Atkinson&rsquo;s next expedition was to the great Desert
of Gobi, sometimes called <i>Scha-ho</i>, or the Sandy
River.&nbsp; Beginning upon the confines of Chinese Tartary, its
vast expanse of sterile wilderness stretches over some twelve
hundred and fifty miles towards the coasts of the Pacific.&nbsp;
It consists in the main of bare rock, shingle, and loose sand,
alternating with fine sand, and sparsely clothed with
vegetation.&nbsp; But a very considerable area, though for a
great part of the year not less monotonously barren, assumes in
the spring the appearance of an immense sea of verdure, and
supplies abundant pasturage to the flocks and herds of the
Mongolian nomads; who wander at will over the wide
&ldquo;prairie-grounds,&rdquo; encamping wherever they find a
sheltering crag or a stream of water.&nbsp; <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>The general
elevation of the Gobi above the sea is about 3500 feet.</p>
<p>It must be owned that the Gobi is not as black as it is
painted.&nbsp; There are fertile nooks and oases, where the
sedentary Mongols, and especially the Artous, sow and reap their
annual crops of hemp, millet, and buckwheat.&nbsp; The largest is
that of Kami.&nbsp; The gloomy picture of &ldquo;a barren plain
of shifting sand, blown into high ridges when the summer sun is
scorching, no rain falls, and when thick fog occurs it is only
the precursor of fierce winds,&rdquo; <a
name="citation211"></a><a href="#footnote211"
class="citation">[211]</a> is true only of the eastern districts,
such as the Han-hai, or &ldquo;Dry Sea,&rdquo; or the Sarkha
Desert, where, for instance, you meet with scarcely any other
vegetation than the <i>Salsoloe</i>, or salt-worts, which
flourish round the small saline pools.&nbsp; &ldquo;In spring and
summer,&rdquo; says Malte Brun, &ldquo;when there is no rain, the
vegetation withers, and the sun-burnt soil inspires the traveller
with sentiments of horror and melancholy; the heat is of short
duration, the winter long and cold.&nbsp; The wild animals met
with are the camel, the horse, the ass, the djiggetai, and troops
of antelopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been observed, and not without reason, that the great
Asiatic desert has exercised a fatal influence on the destinies
of the human race; that it has arrested the extension of the
Semitic civilization.&nbsp; The primitive peoples of India and
Tibet were early civilized; but the immense wilderness which lay
to the westward interposed an impassable barrier between them and
the barbarous tribes of Northern Asia.&nbsp; More surely even
than the Himalaya, more than the snow-crowned summits of Srinagur
and Gorkha, these <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>desert steppes have prevented all communication, all
fusion between the inhabitants of the north and those of the
south of Asia; and thus it is that Tibet and India have remained
the only regions of this part of the world which have enjoyed the
benefits of civilization, of the refinement of manners, and the
genius of the Aryan race.</p>
<p>The barbarians who, when the darkness of ruin hung over the
Roman Empire, invaded and convulsed Europe, issued from the
steppes and table-lands of Mongolia.&nbsp; As Humboldt says <a
name="citation212"></a><a href="#footnote212"
class="citation">[212]</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;If intellectual culture
has directed its course from the east to the west, like the
vivifying light of the sun, barbarism at a later period followed
the same route, when it threatened to plunge Europe again in
darkness.&nbsp; A tawny race of shepherds&mdash;of Thon-Khiu,
that is to say, Turkish origin&mdash;the Hiounguou, inhabited
under sheep-skin tents the elevated table-land of Gobi.&nbsp;
Long formidable to the Chinese power, a portion of the Hiounguou
were driven south in Central Asia.&nbsp; The impulse thus given
uninterruptedly propagated itself to the primitive country of the
Fins, lying on the banks of the Ural, and thence a torrent of
Huns, Avars, Chasars, and divers mixtures of Asiatic races,
poured towards the west and south.&nbsp; The armies of the Huns
first appeared on the banks of the Volga, then in Pannonia,
finally on the borders of the Marne and the Po, ravaging the
beautiful plains where, from the time of Antenor, the genius of
man had accumulated monuments upon monuments.&nbsp; Thus blew
from the Mongolian deserts a pestilential wind which blighted
even in the Cisalpine plains the delicate flower of art, the
object of cares so tender and so constant.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>IV.</h3>
<p>With three Cossacks, seven Kalmucks, eight rifles, and a store
of powder and lead, Mr. Atkinson passed into the Gobi.&nbsp; His
Kalmucks had their hair cut close, except a tuft growing on the
top of the head, which was plaited into a long tail, and hung far
down their back.&nbsp; The chief was named Tchuck-a-bir, a
stalwart, powerful fellow, with a fine manly countenance, large
black eyes, and massive forehead.&nbsp; He wore a horse-skin
cloak, fastened round his waist with a blood-red scarf.&nbsp; In
warm weather he drew his arms from the sleeves, which were then
tucked into his girdle, and the cloak draped around him in
graceful folds, adding to the dignity of his tall and robust
form.</p>
<p>Across the Kourt-Choum mountains the travellers took their
way, directing their course towards the Tanguor chain, many of
the peaks of which soar above the line of eternal snow.&nbsp;
Ascending one of these summits, they enjoyed a noble prospect:
immediately beneath them lay the Oubsa-Noor; to the south-west
were visible the Oulan-Koum Desert and the Aral-Noor; to the
south lay Tchagan Tala, and the ridges descending down to the
Gobi; to the south-east the white crests of the Khangai
Mountains.&nbsp; This was such a view of Central Asia as never
before had European enjoyed.</p>
<p>Keeping far away to the east, they approached the sources of
the Selenga and Djabakan, in the neighbourhood of which he hoped
to meet with the Kalka tribes.&nbsp; In a rich green valley they
came upon one of their auls, and were hospitably received by
Arabdan, <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>the chief, who, according to the custom of the desert,
at once handed to Mr. Atkinson a bowl of tea.&nbsp; Not, indeed,
tea as we English understand it, the clear thin fluid, sweetened
with sugar and tempered with cream; but a thick
&ldquo;slab&rdquo; mixture of tea, milk, butter, salt, and
flour&mdash;tea-soup it might appropriately be called.&nbsp;
Arabdan was tall and thin, between fifty and sixty years of age,
dark-complexioned, with high cheek-bones, small black eyes, a
prominent nose, and a scanty beard.&nbsp; His meagre figure was
wrapped in a long dark-blue silk khalat, buttoned across his
chest; in a leather girdle, adorned with a silver buckle, he
carried his knife, flint, and steel.&nbsp; His helmet-shaped
black silk cap was trimmed with black velvet, and looked very gay
with its two broad red ribbons hanging down behind.&nbsp; This
brave costume was completed by a pair of high-heeled,
madder-coloured boots.&nbsp; As for the women, one wore a robe of
black velvet, the other a khalat of red and green silk; the waist
of each was defined by a broad red sash.&nbsp; Their hair was
fantastically coiffured, falling upon their shoulders in a
hundred small plaits, some of which glittered with coral beads,
the principal toilette ornament of the Mongolian women.&nbsp;
Their red leather boots were very short and high at the heels, so
that they walked as badly and awkwardly as English ladies.&nbsp;
The children wore little more than nature had provided them with;
except that, by rolling in the mud, they contrived to coat their
bodies with reddish ochre, in striking contrast to their elfin
locks of jet black.</p>
<p>Externally the yourts of the Kalkas resemble those of the
Kalmucks, but they differ in the arrangements of the
interior.&nbsp; A small low table is <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>placed opposite the doorway, and
upon it the upper idols, or household gods, and several small
metal vases, are set out.&nbsp; In some are kept grains of
millet; in others, butter, milk, and koumis&mdash;offerings to
the aforesaid deities.&nbsp; On the left side of this altar stand
the boxes which contain the family property, and near them
various domestic utensils and the indispensable koumis bag.&nbsp;
Opposite lie several piles of voilock, on which the family take
their rest.</p>
<p>Immediately on Mr. Atkinson&rsquo;s arrival a sheep was slain
to do him honour, and it was soon steaming in the iron caldron,
with the exception of a portion broiled for his special
delectation.&nbsp; Supper, however, was not served in the
chief&rsquo;s yourt, but in another; to which everybody repaired
with appetites which suggested that they had fasted for
weeks.&nbsp; When the completest possible justice had been done
to the mutton, men, women, and children retired to their rude
couches.</p>
<p>Next morning our indefatigable traveller was once more in the
saddle.&nbsp; We cannot follow him in all the details of his
daily journeyings, which necessarily bore a close resemblance to
one another; but we may accompany him on a visit to the great
Kalkas chief, Darma Tsyren.&nbsp; On entering his yourt, Mr.
Atkinson was entertained with tea-soup as usual.&nbsp; Then, he
says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief sat down in front of me, and the two young
men who had conducted me sat near him&mdash;they were his
sons.&nbsp; Beyond these sat ten or twelve other Kalkas, watching
my movements with intense interest.&nbsp; I was undoubtedly the
first European they had ever seen.&nbsp; My large felt hat,
shooting jacket, <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>and long boots, will be remembered for years to
come&mdash;not that I think they admired the costume; theirs is
far more picturesque.&nbsp; Presently a number of women came into
the yourt, and at their head the wife of the chief.&nbsp; She sat
down near him, and was joined by her daughter; the others got
places where they could; but the gaze of all was upon me.&nbsp;
No doubt it would have been highly amusing could I have
understood their remarks, as they kept up an incessant
talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this moment a Cossack brought my samovar into the
yourt; and these people were much astonished to see the steam
puffing out, with no fire under it.&nbsp; One man placed his hand
on the top, and got his fingers burnt, to the great amusement of
his friends.&nbsp; My dinner of broiled venison was brought in on
a bright tin plate; this and the knife and fork excited their
curiosity&mdash;such articles being quite new to them.&nbsp; They
watched me eat my dinner, and nothing could induce them to move
till the plates were taken away.&nbsp; Darma Tsyren had ordered a
sheep to be killed, which had now been some time in the
caldron.&nbsp; When the announcement was made that it was ready,
I was soon left to myself; the whole aul, men, women, and
children, were shortly enjoying the feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Darma Tsyren Mr. Atkinson obtained the loan of four
Kalkas and twelve horses, and taking also two of his Kalmucks and
two Cossacks, he started on a journey to the river Toss.&nbsp; In
the evening he and his party encamped in a pretty valley, watered
by a small lake, which supplied them with some snipes and ducks
for supper.&nbsp; During the night a pack of wolves visited the
encampment.&nbsp; On receiving warning of their approach by a
distant howl, Mr. Atkinson <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>loaded his double-barrelled gun and
distributed ammunition among his people, in order to give the
unwelcome visitors a warm reception.&nbsp; The horses were
collected, and picketed in a spot between the camp and the
lake.&nbsp; Nearer and nearer came the enemy; the tramp of their
feet could be heard as they galloped forward.&nbsp; They reached
the camp, and through the night air rang their ferocious
howl.&nbsp; Some dry bushes flung on the fire kindled a sudden
flame, which revealed their gaunt figures, with eyes flashing and
ears and tails erect; and immediately a deadly volley crashed
into their midst.&nbsp; With a yell of pain and terror they
turned tail; and Mr. Atkinson and his party hastened to reload
their guns, feeling certain they would return.</p>
<p>The fire flickered down among its embers, and for a time all
was silent.&nbsp; Then arose a stir and an alarm among the
horses; and it was discovered that the pack had divided, one
division stealing upon the animals from the water side, the other
interposing between them and the camp.&nbsp; A rush and a shout
of the Kalmucks and Kalkas drove them back; and a Cossack and a
Kalmuck wore posted on each flank, to guard the approaches and
give the alarm.&nbsp; Moreover, the fire was replenished, and its
glare lighted up the scene for miles around.&nbsp; A hush, and a
moment of expectation!&nbsp; Then might you see the hungry pack
advancing once more to the assault, with eyeballs glaring like
red-hot iron.&nbsp; A crack of rifles on the right was followed
by Mr. Atkinson&rsquo;s two barrels, one of which brought down
its victim, while the other, discharged into the midst of the
pack, wounded two or three.&nbsp; Gradually the growling ceased;
the wolves <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>again retired; but both Kalkas and Kalmucks advised
that a close watch should be kept, as they would certainly make a
third effort.</p>
<p>There was little fuel left, and it was necessary, therefore,
to be doubly vigilant.&nbsp; The night was one of deep darkness,
without moon or stars, and nothing could be seen, even at a short
distance, except towards the lake, where a shimmer of dubious
light rested on the waters.&nbsp; Keen ears and eyes were on the
alert, but no sight or sound of wolf rewarded their
watchfulness.&nbsp; The Kalkas said the wolves were simply
waiting until all was silent in the camp to make another dash at
the horses.&nbsp; For a long time, however, no movement was made,
when two of the horses grew uneasy, tugging at the thongs and
snorting loudly.&nbsp; At the same time, the clouds cleared from
the sky, and the stars peering forth threw more light upon the
lake.&nbsp; Howling was heard in the distance, and Tchuck-a-bir
declared that another pack of wolves was approaching.&nbsp; As
they drew near, the former pack, still lurking in the shades,
began to growl, and it seemed possible that a combined attack
would be delivered.&nbsp; In order to renew the fire, four of the
men, two being armed, crept along the margin of the lake,
returning in about ten minutes, each with an armful of
fuel.&nbsp; The embers were stirred into life, and the brushwood
placed ready to be blown into a flame when wanted.&nbsp; Suddenly
a great tumult arose; the other wolves had come on the scene, and
the echoes rang with a medley of discordant sounds.&nbsp; Again
the watchers waited; and after their patience had been tested for
half an hour, the horses began to pull and plunge in frenzied
terror.&nbsp; The bushes were lighted, and by <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>their blaze
Mr. Atkinson saw a group of eight to ten wolves within fifteen
paces.&nbsp; He fired both barrels at them; his men also fired;
and the herd, with a frightful howl, ignominiously fled.&nbsp; At
daylight Mr. Atkinson examined the scene of action, and found the
carcases of eight wolves.&nbsp; With their skins as trophies, he
returned to Darma Tsyren&rsquo;s aul.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A day or two later, Mr. Atkinson had an adventure with
boars.&nbsp; Leaving four men to guard the camp, he had ridden
out, with five followers, in search of sport.&nbsp; Plunging into
a thick copse of long grass and low bushes, they started more
than one boar from his lair, and tracing them by their motion in
the herbage, galloped in hot pursuit.&nbsp; As they emerged into
the open, they could see two large dark grizzly boars about a
couple of hundred yards ahead, and spurred after them with might
and main.&nbsp; Rapidly they gained upon the panting brutes, and
when within about fifty yards, Mr. Atkinson and a Cossack sprang
from their horses, fired, and wounded one of the boars.&nbsp;
While they reloaded, the rest of the party galloped on, and
presently other shots wore fired.&nbsp; The boars had separated:
one, dashing across the valley, was followed up by two of the
men; the other was pursued by Mr. Atkinson and his Cossack.&nbsp;
After a splendid chase, they drew near enough to see the foam on
his mouth, and his large tusks gnashing with rage.&nbsp; The
Cossack fired; the ball hit him, but did not check his wild,
impetuous course.&nbsp; Swiftly Mr. Atkinson urged on his horse,
got abreast of the animal at about twenty paces distant, and
lodged a bullet in his shoulder.&nbsp; This stopped him, but it
took two more shots to kill <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>him.&nbsp; He proved to be a noble
fellow, weighing nine poods, or about 324 lbs., with long, sharp
tusks, which would have been formidable weapons in a close
encounter.</p>
<p>Leaving the Cossack and a Kalmuck to dress the prize and
convey it to the camp, Mr. Atkinson, after reloading his arms,
hastened to join the rest of his party, who were in full chase on
the other side of the river, at a distance of about three
versts.&nbsp; He rode briskly forward, but the hunt was at an end
before he reached the river.&nbsp; His followers, on joining him,
announced that they had killed a large boar, though not the one
first started.&nbsp; He had escaped, and while they were
searching for his trail amid some reeds and bushes, a large boar
sprang in among them, and charged at a Cossack&rsquo;s
horse.&nbsp; When within three or four paces of his intended
victim he was stopped by a bullet from Tchuck-a-bir&rsquo;s
rifle; but he got away before a second shot could be fired, and
an animated chase began.&nbsp; He received several balls, but
they seemed to have no effect on his impenetrable hide.&nbsp;
Rushing into the river, he swam across, at a point where it
expanded into a deep broad pool; the men followed him, and a ball
from one of the Kalmucks inflicted a severe wound.&nbsp; Furious
with rage and pain, he dashed full at the man who had wounded
him; the Kalmuck dexterously wheeled his horse aside, and a ball
from Tchuck-a-bir laid the monster dead.&nbsp; With two large
boars as the spoils of their prowess, Mr. Atkinson and his
&ldquo;merry men&rdquo; returned to camp triumphant.</p>
<p>Mr. Atkinson next travelled in a southerly direction for two
days; after which he turned to the west, and <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>struck upon
the river Ouremjour; his object being to enter the Gobi to the
north of the great chain of the Thian-Chan, or, as he calls them,
Syan-Shan Mountains.&nbsp; These are the highest in Central Asia,
and amongst them rises that stupendous mass, Bogda O&ouml;la,
with the volcanoes Pe-shan and Hothaou, to see which was his
leading purpose and aim.&nbsp; He gives an animated description
of his approach to the Syan-Shan.&nbsp; A bright sun was rising
behind the wayfarer, but its rays had not yet gilded the snowy
peaks in his front.&nbsp; As he rode onward he watched for the
first bright gleam that lighted up the ice and snow on Bogda
O&ouml;la; presently the great crest reddened with a magical
glow, which gradually spread over the rugged sides, and as it
descended, changed into yellow and then into silvery white.&nbsp;
For many minutes Bogda O&ouml;la was bathed in sunshine before
the rays touched any of the lower peaks.&nbsp; But in due time
summit after summit shot rapidly into the brave red light, and at
last the whole chain shone in huge waves of molten silver, though
a hazy gloom still clothed the inferior ranges.&nbsp; In these
atmospheric effects we cannot but recognize a marvellous grandeur
and impressiveness; there is something sublimely weird in the
sudden changes they work among the stupendous mountain
masses.&nbsp; Onward fared the traveller, obtaining a still finer
view of Bogda O&ouml;la, and of some of the other peaks to the
west; but, as the day advanced, the clouds began to fold around
its head, and the huge peak was soon clothed with thick surging
wreaths of vapour.&nbsp; The lower range of the Syan-Shan is
picturesque in the extreme; jagged peaks stand out in bold relief
against the snow-shrouded masses, which tower up some <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>eight to
ten thousand feet above them, while the latter are clothed with a
luminous purple mist that seems not to belong to this
world.&nbsp; Mr. Atkinson continued his route in a north-westerly
direction, towards one of the lower chains which run nearly
parallel with the Syan-Shan.&nbsp; Thence he could see the Bogda
O&ouml;la in all its grand sublimity, and the volcanic peak
Pe-shan, with black crags outlined against the snow, still
further to the west; while beyond these a long line of
snow-capped summits melted into the vaporous distance.</p>
<p>In the course of his wanderings in Chinese Tartary, our
traveller saw much of the Kirghiz chiefs, the Sultans of the
steppes.&nbsp; On one occasion, while riding in the sterile
desert, he fell in with the aul of Sultan Ishonac Khan&mdash;a
stoutly built man, with strong-marked Kalmuck features, who, in
right of his descent from the famous Genghiz Khan, wore an
owl&rsquo;s feather suspended from the top of his cap.&nbsp; His
costume was gallant and gay; Chinese silk, richly
embroidered.</p>
<p>About fifty versts to the south of Sultan Ishonac&rsquo;s aul,
lie the Barluck Mountains, situated between the Tarbagatai and
the Alatou Mountains, and eastward of the small rocky chain of
the Ala-Kool, which extends some sixty versts from east to west,
and measures about twenty-five in breadth.&nbsp; The highest
summit is not more than three thousand feet above the
plain.&nbsp; Vegetation thrives on the lower slopes, but the
upper parts are gloomily bare.&nbsp; From Sultan Ishonac Khan Mr.
Atkinson obtained a loan of fresh horses, and of eight of his
Kirghiz to escort him to the Tarbagatai.&nbsp; A dreary ride <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>it
was,&mdash;over sandy hills, through sandy valleys, where not
even a blade of grass was green.&nbsp; In many places the ground
was thickly covered with a saline incrustation, which the
horses&rsquo; feet churned up into a pungent dust, that filled
every mouth and caused intolerable thirst.&nbsp; Welcome was the
glimmer of a lake that relieved by its sparkle the dulness of the
landscape; but when horse and man rushed forward to drink of its
waters, to their intense disappointment they found them bitter as
those of Marah.&nbsp; Not till the evening of the fifth day, when
they reached the river Eremil, did they enjoy the luxury of fresh
water.</p>
<p>Next day they reached the Tarbagatai, in the neighbourhood of
the Chinese town of Tchoubuchack, and encamped for the night at
the foot of a great tumulus or barrow, about one hundred and
fifty feet high, which is surrounded by many smaller
barrows.&nbsp; They are the last resting-places of a Kirghiz
chief and his people, who belonged to a remote generation, and to
a race of which these tumuli are the only memorials.&nbsp;
Another day&rsquo;s ride, and they arrived at the aul of Sultan
Iamantuck, of whom and his family Mr. Atkinson speaks as by far
the most intelligent people he met with in this part of
Asia.&nbsp; The aul was pitched among high conical tombs of
sun-burnt bricks, the cemetery of the Sultan&rsquo;s ancestors;
and it appears that once a year it was regularly visited by their
pious descendant and representative.&nbsp; With another relay of
horses and a fresh Kirghiz escort, Mr. Atkinson dashed onward,
undeterred by the dreariness of the sandy level, where neither
water nor grass was to be found, and the only living things were
tarantulas and scorpions.&nbsp; His course lay direct for the
Alatou <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>(&ldquo;Variegated Mountains&rdquo;), and he could see
the shining peaks of the Actou (&ldquo;White Mountain&rdquo;),
which forms its highest crest, and raises its summits fourteen to
fifteen thousand feet above the sea.&nbsp; After fording the
broad deep stream of the Yeljen-sa-gash, he arrived on the shore
of Lake Ala-kool, measuring about sixty-five versts in length by
twenty in width, with a rocky island near the north shore,
erroneously described by Humboldt as the site of a volcano.&nbsp;
It has no outlet, yet it receives the tribute of eight rivers;
the water is carried off by evaporation.</p>
<p>Here Mr. Atkinson struck westward to find the aul of Sultan
Bak, the Rothschild of the steppes; a man who owns ten thousand
horses, and a proportionate number of camels, sheep, and
oxen.&nbsp; Wealthy men are not always well disposed towards
stranger guests, and Sultan Bak evinced his dislike of intrusion
by sending Mr. Atkinson a diseased sheep!&nbsp; This was
immediately returned, with an intimation that Mr. Atkinson wanted
neither his company nor his gifts; he was the first Sultan who
had shown himself so discourteous, and though he had a large
body, it was clear his heart was that of a mouse.&nbsp; It is not
surprising that a message of this kind provoked him to
wrath.&nbsp; He ordered the intruders to quit his aul; if they
did not, his men should drive them into the lake.&nbsp; But when
he found that they were well armed, that discretion which is the
better part of valour enabled him to subdue his temper; he sent
one of his finest sheep as a peace-offering, with an assurance
that they might stay as long as they liked, and should have men
and horses when they left.&nbsp; Evidently the Kirghiz patriarch
knew how to make the best of a bad situation.</p>
<p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>Accompanied by his poet, he paid a visit to Mr.
Atkinson&rsquo;s camp, supped heartily off his own mutton, and
exchanged the warmest professions of friendship.&nbsp; The
minstrel, at his master&rsquo;s bidding, sang wild songs to
wilder tunes in glorification of the prowess and freebooting
expeditions of the Sultan and his ancestors, to the great
edification of the listening Kirghiz.&nbsp; So the evening passed
peacefully, and the Sultan and the white man parted on cordial
terms.&nbsp; Next day, Mr. Atkinson was riding towards the
Karatou, a mountainous chain of dark purple slate; and six days
later he visited Sultan Boubania, on the river Lepson.&nbsp; In
the neighbourhood were many large tumuli, the largest being the
most ancient.&nbsp; One of these was built up of stone, and
formed a circle of 364 feet in diameter, with a dome-like mound
thirty-three feet in height.&nbsp; Tradition has not preserved
the name of the dead honoured with so extraordinary a memorial;
the Kirghiz attribute it to demons working under the direction of
Shaitan.&nbsp; Another kind of tumulus, of more recent
construction, was circular in plan, but carried up to the height
of fifty-four feet, in the shape of &ldquo;a blast
furnace,&rdquo; with an aperture at the top, and lateral opening
two feet square and four feet from the ground.&nbsp; In the
interior were two graves covered with large blocks of
stone.&nbsp; According to the Kirghiz, these tombs were built by
the people who inhabited the country before the Kalmucks.&nbsp; A
third kind, of sunburnt bricks, and Mohammedan in design, are
ascribed to Timour Khan and his race.</p>
<p>Through the rocky gorge of the Bal&iuml;&iuml;tz, Mr. Atkinson
commenced his ascent of the Alatou.&nbsp; His eye rested with
pleasure on the richly coloured rocks <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>that composed the cliffs on either
side&mdash;deep red porphyry, flecked with veins of white; slate,
jasper, and basalt.&nbsp; He explored several of the valleys that
break up the lower mass of the mountain chain, and rode along
many of its elevated ridges.&nbsp; Sometimes the roar of torrents
filled his ears; sometimes bright streams and sources sparkled in
the sunshine; sometimes he saw before him a fair mosaic of wild
flowers; sometimes the landscape was ennobled by the conspicuous
figures of white mountain peaks, relieved by a background of deep
blue sky; sometimes the distant vapours hovered wraith-like above
the calm surface of Lake Tengiz.&nbsp; From a plateau not far
beneath the line of perpetual snow he obtained a noble view of
the Actou, and, to the south, of the lofty and picturesque peaks
of the Alatou; while, nearer at hand, the river Ara poured its
thunderous waters into a gorge some thousand feet in depth.&nbsp;
The plateau was covered with tumuli; one of which, measuring two
hundred feet in diameter and forty feet in height, was enclosed
within a trench, twelve feet wide and six feet deep.&nbsp; On the
west side stood four masses of large stones in circles; the
altars, perhaps, on which, long ago, victims were sacrificed to
appease some sanguinary deity.&nbsp; It is a tradition of the
Kirghiz that these antiquities belonged to a native who, for some
unknown cause, determined on a great act of murder and
self-destruction, and that they were constructed before the
terrible work was begun.&nbsp; They say that the father killed
his wife and all his children, excepting the eldest son, on whom
devolved the duty of killing, first his father, and then
himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Atkinson visited, near the river Kopal, the <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>Arasan, or
warm spring, which wells up in the centre Of a ravine formed of
yellow and purple marbles.&nbsp; Its temperature, all round the
year, is 29&prime; R. or 97&deg; F.&nbsp; Here, in a remote past,
the Kalmucks built a bath, which is still frequented by Tartars,
Kirghiz, and Chinese.&nbsp; The waters, it is said, are
wonderfully beneficial for scurvy and other cutaneous
disorders.</p>
<p>Another route carried him to the Tamchi-Boulac, or
&ldquo;Dropping Spring,&rdquo; at the foot of the Alatou.&nbsp;
The water oozes out of columnar cliffs in myriads of tiny streams
that glitter like showers of diamonds; while in some parts they
seem changed to drops of liquid fire by the reflected colouring
of the rocks, which vary in colour from a bright yellow to a deep
red.</p>
<p>For one hundred and three days Mr. Atkinson wandered among the
Alatou Mountains, exploring peak, precipice, valley, and ravine;
surveying torrent and river and waterfall; now ascending far
above the line of perpetual snow, now descending into warm and
sheltered woods, where the greensward was enamelled with
blossoms.&nbsp; From the eastern end of the Alatou, a seventeen
days&rsquo; ride over hill and steppe brought him to the Russian
frontier and the comforts of civilization at Semipalatinsk.&nbsp;
But, almost as strongly possessed with the spirit of continuous
motion as the Wandering Jew in the grim old legend, he next set
forth on a journey across Siberia, from its western boundary on
the Irtisch, to its Oriental capital, Irkutsk.&nbsp; In the
course of his long journey he visited the Saian Mountains;
ascended the valley of the Oka; explored a bed of lava and a
volcanic crater in the valley of the Ojem-a-louk; rode across the
rugged shoulder of Nouk-a-Daban; and descended <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>the little
river Koultouk to Lake Baikal, or, as the natives call it, the
Holy Sea.&nbsp; Hiring a small boat, with a crew of seven men, he
crossed the lake to the mouth of the river Angara.&nbsp; Baikal
is the third largest lake in Asia&mdash;about four hundred miles
in length, and varying in breadth from nineteen miles to
seventy.&nbsp; Though fed by numerous streams, it has only one
outlet, the Angara, a tributary of the Yenisei.&nbsp; Lying deep
among the Baikal Mountains, an off-shoot of the Altai, it
presents some vividly coloured and striking scenery.&nbsp; Its
fisheries are valuable.&nbsp; In the great chain of communication
between Russia and China it holds an important place, and of late
years its navigation has been conducted by steamboats.&nbsp; The
native peoples inhabiting its borders are the Buriats and
Tungusians.</p>
<p>Mr. Atkinson spent eight and twenty days in exploring this
Alpine sea, and afterwards proceeded to Irkutsk. <a

229</span>ALEXINA TINN&Eacute;<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND HER WANDERINGS IN THE
SOUDAN.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> 1862, letters from
Khart&ucirc;m, the capital of Nubia, stimulated the curiosity of
European geographers by announcing that three courageous ladies
had undertaken a journey into Central Africa, with the view of
reaching those mysterious Sources of the Nile which, for
generations, had been the object of Western research.&nbsp; At
first the news was received with suspicion; many persons did not
hesitate to speak of it as a hoax; but incredulity vanished as
the information grew more copious and more precise, and it became
known that the guiding spirit of the adventure was a certain Miss
Alexandrina or Alexina Tinn&eacute;, a lady of great personal
charms and very wealthy.&nbsp; It was then unanimously agreed
that she was one of those brave daughters of England who, in the
Continental belief, will go anywhere and do anything that is
hazardous or eccentric.&nbsp; And though of Dutch extraction she
really did owe something to English influences.&nbsp; Her father
was a Dutch merchant who, after acquiring an ample fortune in
Demerara, was naturalised in England, and finally settled at
Liverpool.&nbsp; He died while Alexina (born in October, <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>1835) was
still a child, but the wealthy heiress was brought up by her
mother as befitted her social position.&nbsp; What impelled her,
in her young maidenhood, to plunge into the dangers of African
exploration&mdash;whether her action was due to a love of
adventure, a thirst after knowledge, a spirit rebelling against
the conventionalisms of society, or to baffled hope and slighted
affection&mdash;does not seem to be known.&nbsp; But it is
certain that about 1859 she set out from the Hague, accompanied
by her mother and aunt, and visited various parts of Egypt and
Syria.&nbsp; For some months she resided at Beirut and Tripoli;
next she repaired to Damascus; afterwards, to the ruins of
Palmyra, haunted by the memory of Zenobia; and, finally, she
dreamed of imitating the romantic career of Lady Hester Stanhope,
and installing herself as Queen of the Lebanon.&nbsp; Her mood,
however, changed suddenly; she returned to Europe, not to resume
the monotonous habits of social life, but to make preparations
for an expedition in search of the Sources of the Nile.</p>
<p>In this daring project she appears to have been encouraged
partly by her own fearlessness of nature; partly by the example
of Mrs. Petherick, wife of the English consul at Khart&ucirc;m,
whose fame had spread far and wide; and partly by the flattering
thought that it might be reserved for her, a woman, to succeed
where so many brave men had failed, and to be the first to solve
the great enigma of the Nilotic sphynx.&nbsp; What immortality
would be hers if she triumphed over every danger and difficulty,
and stood, where no European as yet had stood, on the margin of
the remote well-head, the long secret <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>spring, whence issued the waters of
Egypt&rsquo;s historic river!&nbsp; It must be owned that in this
ambitious hope there was nothing mean or unworthy, and that it
could have been possible only to a high and courageous
nature.</p>
<p>She set out in the month of July, 1861, still accompanied by
her mother and her aunt, two ladies of mediocre character, who
readily yielded to the influence of a stronger mind.&nbsp; A part
of the winter was spent in a pleasant country house in one of the
suburbs of Cairo&mdash;a kind of palace of white marble, situated
in the midst of odorous gardens, and looking out upon the ample
Nile and the giant forms of the Pyramids.&nbsp; There they made
extensive preparations for the contemplated journey; while
Alexina spent many thoughtful hours in studying the map of
Africa, in tracing the sinuosities of the White Nile above its
point of junction with the Blue, in laying down the route which
should carry her and her companions into the regions of the great
lakes.</p>
<p>It was on the 9th of January, 1862, that she and her
companions directed their course towards Upper Egypt, voyaging in
three boats, attended by a numerous train of guides, guards, and
servants.&nbsp; In the largest and most commodious
&ldquo;dahabeeyah&rdquo; were installed the three ladies, with
four European servants and a Syrian cook.&nbsp; Alexina&rsquo;s
journal, it is said, preserves many curious details in
unconscious illustration of the mixed character of the
expedition, which might almost have been that of a new Cleopatra
going to meet a new Mark Antony; we see the Beauty there as well
as the Heroine&mdash;the handsome woman who is mindful of her
toilette appliances, <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>as well as the courageous explorer,
who does not forget her rifle and cartridges.</p>
<p>Passing in safety the first cataract, Miss
Tinn&eacute;&rsquo;s expedition duly arrived at Kousko; where she
and her companions took a temporary leave of the Nile, tourists,
and civilization, and struck across the sandy desert of Kousko to
Abu-Hammed, in order to avoid the wide curve which the river
there makes to the westward.&nbsp; The caravan, besides Miss
Tinn&eacute;&rsquo;s domestics, included six guides and
twenty-five armed men.&nbsp; Of camels loaded with baggage and
provisions, and dromedaries which carried the members of her
suite, there were a hundred and ten.&nbsp; The desert did not
prove so dreary as it had been painted; sand and rock were often
relieved by patches of blooming vegetation; the monotony of the
plains was often broken by ridges of swelling hills.&nbsp; The
camels every evening browsed contentedly on the herbage, and
quenched their thirst in the basins of water that sparkled in the
rocky hollows.</p>
<p>The time usually required for crossing the desert is eight to
nine days; but as Alexina advanced very leisurely, by daily
stages not exceeding seven or eight hours, she occupied nearly
three weeks.&nbsp; In spite of this easy mode of travelling, her
mother was so fatigued that, on arriving at Abu-Hammed, on the
banks of the Nile, she insisted they should again take to the
river.&nbsp; A dahabeeyah was accordingly hired, along with six
stalwart boatmen, who swore on the Koran to keep pace with the
swiftest dromedaries.&nbsp; So while the caravan tramped onwards
through the burning, shifting sand, Alexina and her companions
voyaged up the Nile; but the rowers <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>soon proved false to their promises,
slackened their oars, and allowed the caravan to outstrip
them.&nbsp; When reproached with their lethargy, they excused
themselves on the score of the arduousness of their work and the
great heat of the sun.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the caravan had made considerable progress, and at
nightfall tents were pitched and fires lighted.&nbsp; As no
dahabeeyah could be seen, men were sent in search of it; but in
vain.&nbsp; No news of it was obtained until the following day,
when it was ascertained that the Egyptian boatmen had at last
laid down their oars in sullen indolence, and that Miss
Tinn&eacute; and her companions had been compelled to spend the
night in a Nubian village.&nbsp; The misadventure taught them the
lesson that in Eastern countries it is generally wiser to trust
to brutes than to men; the boatmen were dismissed, and the
travellers once more joined the caravan.</p>
<p>But the heat proved insupportable, driving them to make a
second experiment of the river traject.&nbsp; A boat was again
hired; again they embarked on the glittering Nile; and again an
evil fortune attended them.&nbsp; Instead of reaching Berber, as
they should have done, in four days, the voyage was extended to
over a week; but it was some compensation for their fatigue when,
at two hours&rsquo; march from the city, they were received by
some thirty chiefs, mounted upon camels, and attended by
janizaries in splendid attire, who, with much pomp and
circumstance, escorted them to the gates of Berber.&nbsp; There
they were received by the governor with every detail of Oriental
etiquette, installed in pavilions in his gardens, and waited upon
in a spirit of the most courteous hospitality.&nbsp; <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>No longer
in need of a complete caravan, Miss Tinn&eacute; dismissed her
camel-drivers; but, desirous of leaving upon their minds an
enduring impression, she rewarded them with almost prodigal
liberality.&nbsp; Her gold coins were so lavishly distributed,
that the Arabs, in surprise and delight, broke out into
unaccustomed salutations; and to this very day, remembering her
largesses, they sing of her glory, as if she had revived the
splendour of Palmyra.</p>
<p>There was a policy in this apparently thoughtless
profusion.&nbsp; As a natural result, her reputation everywhere
preceded her; hospitality was pressed upon her with an eagerness
which may have been dictated by selfish motives, but was not the
less acceptable to her and her companions.&nbsp; Women, gathering
round her, prostrated themselves at her feet.&nbsp; The young
girls danced merrily at her approach; they took her for a
princess, or, at least, they saluted her as such.</p>
<p>After a residence of some weeks at Berber, the adventurous
ladies hired three boats, and ascended the Nile to Khart&ucirc;m,
the capital of the Egyptian Soudan.&nbsp; Situated at the
confluence of the White and Blue Nile, it is the centre of an
important commerce, and the rendezvous of almost all the caravans
of Nubia and the Upper Nile.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is one of
the world&rsquo;s <i>cloacin&aelig;</i>, a kind of moral
cesspool, into which the filth and uncleanness of many nations
pours&mdash;Italians, Germans, Frenchmen, Englishmen, whom their
own countries have repudiated; political gamblers, who have
played their best card and failed; fraudulent bankrupts,
unscrupulous speculators, men who have nothing to hope, nothing
to lose, and are too callous to fear.&nbsp; The great scourge of
the place, <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>down to a very recent date, was the cruel
slave-traffic, at that time carried on with the connivance of the
Egyptian Government.&nbsp; Recently the energetic measures of
Colonel Gordon have done much towards the extirpation of this
cancerous growth, and even the moral atmosphere of the town has
been greatly purified.&nbsp; To Alexina Tinn&eacute; the place
was sufficiently loathsome; but a residence of some weeks&rsquo;
duration, while preparations were made for the advance into
Central Africa, was imperative.&nbsp; She did what she could to
avoid coming into contact with the &ldquo;society&rdquo; of
Khart&ucirc;m, and exerted all her energies to stimulate the
labours of her subordinates, so that she might depart at the
earliest possible moment.&nbsp; At length, provisions were
collected, and a supply of trinkets to be used as gifts or in
barter; an escort of thirty-eight men, including ten soldiers
fully armed, and all bearing a good character for
trustworthiness, was engaged; and, finally, she hired for the
heavy sum of ten thousand francs, a small steamboat, belonging to
Prince Halim.&nbsp; With a glad heart she quitted Khart&ucirc;m,
and resumed the ascent of the White Nile, passing through a
succession of landscapes fair and fertile.&nbsp; As for the
river, its quiet beauty charmed her; and she compared it to
Virginia Lake, the pretty basin of water that sparkles in the
leafy shades of Windsor Forest.&nbsp; Its banks are richly
clothed with trees, chiefly gumtrees, which frequently attain the
dimensions of the oak.&nbsp; But the graceful tamarisk is also
abundant, and myriads of shrubs furnish the blue ape with a
refuge and a home.&nbsp; The air glitters with the many-coloured
wings of swarms of birds.&nbsp; On the bright surface of the
stream spread the broad leaves and <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>white petals of colossal lilies,
among which the hippopotamus and the crocodile pursue their
unwieldy gambols.</p>
<p>How marvellous the effects of colour when this magical scene
is bathed in the hot rays of the sunshine!&nbsp; Through the
transparent air every object is seen with a distinct outline, and
the sense of distance is overcome.&nbsp; Where a shadow falls it
is defined as sharply as on canvas; there is no softening or
confusing mist; you see everything as in a mirror.&nbsp; In the
noontide heats all nature is as silent here as in a virgin
forest; but when the cool breath of evening begins to be felt,
and that luminous darkness, which is the glory of a summer night
in Central Africa, spreads softly over the picture, the multiform
life of earth swiftly re-awakens; birds and butterflies hover in
the air, the monkeys chatter merrily, and leap from bough to
bough.&nbsp; The sounds which then break forth&mdash;song and hum
and murmur, the roll of the river, the din of insects, the cries
of the wild beasts&mdash;seem all to mingle in one grand vesper
hymn, proclaiming the might and majesty of the Creator.&nbsp;
These are generally hushed as the night wears on; and then
myriads of fireflies and glow-worms light their tiny torches and
illuminate the dark with a magical display; while the air is
charged with sweet and subtle odours exhaled from the corollas of
the plants which open only during the cool and tranquil
hours.</p>
<p>While slowly making her way up the river, Alexina encountered
an Egyptian pasha, who was returning with a booty of slaves from
a recent razzia.&nbsp; She eagerly implored him to set the
unhappy captives <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>free, and when her solicitations failed, purchased
eight of the poor creatures, to whom she immediately gave their
liberty, supplying them also with provisions.&nbsp; This has been
termed an act of Quixotism; it was rather one of generous womanly
enthusiasm, and to our thinking redeems the failings of Alexina
Tinn&eacute;&rsquo;s character&mdash;compensates for the follies
and frivolities which encumbered her enterprise.&nbsp; Her heart
was true to every gentle impulse, and she ceased not to suffer
keenly at the sight of the wretched condition of the poor negroes
who fell victims to an unholy traffic.</p>
<p>This traffic had aroused such feelings of hatred and revenge
in the breasts of the riverine tribes of the Nile, that the
passage of the river had become very dangerous, and the journey
by land almost impossible.&nbsp; The natives looked upon every
white man as a Turk and a slave-dealer; and when a boat appeared
on the horizon, mothers cried with terror to their children,
&ldquo;The Tourk&eacute;, the Tourk&eacute; are
coming!&rdquo;&nbsp; The scarlet tarbouch, or fez, added to the
repulsion.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the colour of blood just
spilled,&rdquo; said a negro to his family.&nbsp; &ldquo;It never
fades,&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;the Turk renews it constantly in
the blood of the poor black men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately, they were able to distinguish between the boats
of the slave-dealers and Alexina Tinn&eacute;&rsquo;s
steamer.&nbsp; Twice or thrice they approached the latter; at
first not without fear, but afterwards with good courage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is the young lady who commands,&rdquo; they asked,
&ldquo;the Sultan&rsquo;s sister?&nbsp; Does she come to assist
or to persecute us?&rdquo;&nbsp; When fully informed of the
object of her pacific expedition, they rapidly grew familiar and
ventured on board her boat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since you <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>mean no
evil against us,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;we will do <i>you</i>
no harm; we will love you!&rdquo;&nbsp; They accepted from her
hands a cup of tea, and courteously drank it without manifesting
their repugnance; and they explained to her their usages and
manners, and supplied her with interesting information respecting
the surrounding country.&nbsp; Her reception was so much to her
mind, that she would have remained for some time among this
kindly people, had she not felt bound to prosecute her journey to
the south.</p>
<p>Once more the sails were unfurled, the fires lighted, and the
steamer ploughed its steady course towards the land of the
Derikas.&nbsp; Two or three villages were seen on the river
banks, but the landscape was bare and bland, and the adventurous
Alexina pursued her voyage until she reached Mount Hunaya.&nbsp;
There she landed and pitched her tents.&nbsp; When it was known
to be her design to remain in this encampment during the rainy
season, her followers raised a vehement opposition, protesting
that they would be devoured by lions or trampled to death by
elephants.&nbsp; Their mistress, however, remained firm in her
intention; but as the steamer was in need of repair, she sent it
back to Khart&ucirc;m in charge of her aunt.</p>
<p>It was during this lady&rsquo;s enforced residence at
Khart&ucirc;m that she made the acquaintance of an Englishman and
his wife, whose names have become household words in every
civilized nation&mdash;Sir Samuel and Lady Baker.&nbsp; Sir
Samuel, who belongs to the illustrious company of African
explorers, began his career of adventure by founding an
agricultural colony at Nuvera Ellia&mdash;that is, six thousand
feet above the sea, among the breezy mountain peaks <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>of
Ceylon.&nbsp; In 1855 he visited the Crimea, and afterwards he
was engaged in superintending in Turkey the organization of its
first railway.&nbsp; In 1861 he started with his wife on a
journey of discovery in Central Africa, with the design of
meeting the Government expedition, which, under Captain Speke,
had been despatched in search of the Nile sources.&nbsp; In
nearly a year he and his wife explored the Abyssinian highlands,
which form the cradle of the Blue Nile, arriving at Khart&ucirc;m
in June, 1862.&nbsp; There he collected a large company to ascend
the Upper Nile, and setting out in December, 1862, he reached
Gondokoro in February, 1863, in time to meet Captain Speke and
Grant returning victoriously from their discovery of the Victoria
Nyanza.&nbsp; Baker furnished them with the means of transport to
Khart&ucirc;m, and then pushed forward across a district infested
by slave-hunters, until he fell in with a great fresh-water
basin, the Luta N&rsquo;zize, which he christened the Albert
Lake, or Nyanza, and ascertained to be one of the chief
reservoirs or feeders of the Nile.&nbsp; He returned to England
in 1866.&nbsp; Three years later, he accepted from the Khedive of
Egypt the command of a military force, with unlimited powers, for
the purpose of annexing savage Africa to the civilized world, and
opening up its fertile lake-regions to the enterprise of
legitimate commerce.&nbsp; The work, which was well done,
occupied him until 1873, and was afterwards carried on by Colonel
Gordon.</p>
<p>In all his adventures, which, as we shall see, were often of a
most critical character, Sir Samuel was accompanied by his wife,
whose sympathy consoled, while her example inspired him.&nbsp;
This brave and <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>chivalrous lady gave abundant proof of her heroic
courage, her devoted affection, and her indomitable
resolution.</p>
<p>When the repairs of her vessel were completed, Alexina
Tinn&eacute; returned to Gebel Hunaya.&nbsp; She was received
with shouts of joy, and with a salute of several pieces of
artillery, which awakened the greatest trepidation among the
natives.&nbsp; Some few incidents had occurred during her
absence, but none of a very notable character.&nbsp; One morning,
Alexina was reading at a short distance from the camp.&nbsp;
Feeling thirsty, she turned towards a rivulet which sparkled
among the herbage close at hand; but as she approached it, the
dog which accompanied her barked loudly with affright, and showed
a manifest unwillingness to draw nearer to the rocks impending
over the stream.&nbsp; Accepting this intimation of danger,
Alexina stepped forward very cautiously, and soon discovered a
young panther lurking behind the rugged boulders.&nbsp; She had
the presence of mind to stand perfectly still, while she summoned
her soldiers and servants to her assistance.&nbsp; They speedily
came up, and, drawing a cordon round the animal, succeeded in
capturing it alive.&nbsp; On another occasion, her men killed,
before her eyes, a huge crocodile, which was duly stuffed as a
trophy.&nbsp; They also caught a great ape, whose head was
covered with long hair, mixed black and white.&nbsp; The animal
would have been a valuable specimen of the African fauna, but,
unfortunately, it died within a few months of its capture.</p>
<p>On the 7th of July, the steamer, which was heavily loaded and
towed two boats, left Hunaya, to continue its course up the
river.&nbsp; Between Hunaya and the <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>confluence of the Bahr-el-Ghazal
(the Gazelle river) the scenery is far from being attractive; the
river banks are arid, and sunburnt.&nbsp; Here and there,
however, grow clumps of whispering reeds and aquatic plants;
while, at other points, the river overflows its limits for two or
three thousand yards, creating, on each side, an inaccessible
swamp.</p>
<p>The voyagers did not pause until they reached the settlement
of an Arab chief, named Mohammed-Cher, who by his audacity had
subjected the neighbouring tribes, and ruled supreme over this
part of the Soudan.&nbsp; When, as frequently happened, he was in
want of money, he exercised the right of the strong hand, and, at
the head of his freebooters, sallied forth; destroying villages,
slaying the male inhabitants, seizing upon the women and
children, and carrying off the cattle.&nbsp; He loved to surround
himself with barbaric pomp, and paraded upon a magnificent horse,
the saddle of which was embroidered with gold and silver, and
sparkled with precious stones.&nbsp; But when our voyagers
arrived at his village, this great warrior showed signs of
recreancy; he was terrified by the Turkish soldiers who occupied
the steamer&rsquo;s deck.&nbsp; It was supposed to be owing to
this spasm of alarm that he received the ladies with royal
honours, sending them sheep, oxen, fruit, vegetables, dancers,
arch&aelig;ological curiosities; in short, he seemed anxious to
offer them all he possessed.&nbsp; Afterwards, however, the
secret of his ready liberality came out; the swarthy chieftain
thought he was doing honour to the favourite daughter of the
Grand Turk&mdash;in his zeal, he was anxious to proclaim her
Queen of the Soudan.</p>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>When
his visitors were taking leave, he strongly advised them not to
advance further to the south.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;you do not come into collision with the Shillooks, who
are our sworn enemies, and the enemies of all who cross their
frontiers.&nbsp; Take care that they do not set fire to your
boats, as they have already done to all vessels coming from
Khart&ucirc;m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of these warnings, Alexina Tinn&eacute; resolutely
continued her voyage, and, a few days later, anchored off a
Shillook village.&nbsp; The sailors, frightened by
Mohammed&rsquo;s story, would not approach it; she therefore
landed with only an interpreter, an officer, and an escort of ten
soldiers.&nbsp; But the news of the arrival of a daughter of the
Sultan had preceded her, and instead of being received as an
enemy, she was welcomed with every demonstration of
respect.&nbsp; The Shillooks, as is the case with savage tribes
in all parts of the world, endeavour to engage every stranger in
their personal enmities; and they now hoped to secure the
assistance of the expedition against that terrible Mohammed-Cher,
who, only a few days before, had shown so much anxiety to
proclaim the European lady Queen of the Soudan.&nbsp; When she
refused to join in their campaign, their disappointment was
extreme.&nbsp; All travellers speak warmly of this unfortunate
tribe, who suffer scarcely less from Europeans than from
Arabs.&nbsp; The conditions under which they live are very
pitiful; wherever they turn, they are met by enemies.&nbsp;
Constantly falling victims to the cruelty of the slave-hunters,
it is no wonder that they regard with suspicion, and too often
treat with ferocity, the strangers who come <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>among them;
naturally implicating them in the traffic by which they suffer so
severely.&nbsp; The slave-hunting abomination is, we must repeat,
the mortal wound of Central Africa; it impedes commercial
enterprise, and paralyzes the efforts of the pioneers of
Christian civilization.&nbsp; Let us hope that, in the lake
regions, the vigorous action of Colonel Gordon has greatly
diminished, if it has not absolutely rooted out, the evil.</p>
<p>Pressing southward with unshaken resolution, Alexina
Tinn&eacute; reached at length the junction of the Sobat with the
Nile.&nbsp; She resolved to ascend that tributary as far as it
was navigable, calculating that the <i>excursus</i>, going and
returning, would occupy seven or eight days.&nbsp; The valley of
the Sobat is more interesting in character than much of the
course of the White Nile.&nbsp; Its broad pastures, stretching
away to the distant horizon, teem with flocks of ostriches and
herds of giraffes.&nbsp; The river banks are thickly indented by
the heavy hoofs of elephants, and the colossal animals themselves
wander freely over the uplands.&nbsp; For some weeks the voyagers
lingered in the Sobat, well pleased with its succession of
striking scenes; and then they steamed up the Nile again, until
they reached the mouth of the Bahr-el-Ghazal, the majestic stream
which, with slow current, traverses Lake N&ucirc;.</p>
<p>Here the Nile strikes sharply towards the south, forming a
complete right angle; and broadens into an imposing expanse of
shining waters.</p>
<p>The flora of the surrounding country is very picturesque:
tamarinds, mimosas, climbing plants, the papyruses, and the
euphorbias thrive in unchecked <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>luxuriance, as they have thriven for
countless centuries, and blend together their thick growth of
various foliage.&nbsp; The colouring of the flowers is often so
intense that the eye aches in contemplating it.&nbsp; It should
be added that the euphorbia, which is very common in this region,
yields a poisonous milky juice, in which the natives dip their
arrows.&nbsp; A scratch from one of these envenomed weapons will
rapidly prove mortal.</p>
<p>Beyond Lake N&ucirc;, the White Nile breaks into an intricate
series of curves and meanders, pouring its waters downwards with
violent swiftness.&nbsp; Such, indeed, was the strength of the
flood, that the steamer was compelled to throw off the
towing-rope of the two dahabiehs, and the sailors and servants
landed in order to haul them against the stream.&nbsp; But in the
greatest stress of the current the rope broke, and the boats,
drifting away, were threatened with destruction.&nbsp; Osman Aga,
a resolute and courageous soldier, who was on the deck of the
steamer, seized another rope and leaped instantly into the
river.&nbsp; With vigorous strokes he made for the shore.&nbsp;
He had almost gained it, and had flung the rope to his expectant
comrades, when he suddenly disappeared.&nbsp; After a while his
dead body was found, and immediate preparations were made to give
it an honourable burial.&nbsp; Wrapped round, according to the
custom of the country, with twenty yards of calico, it was
interred, in the presence of the whole crew, at the foot of a
patriarchal tree, on the trunk of which was cut a commemorative
inscription.</p>
<p>Some days after this melancholy event, the expedition ascended
the river to Heiligenkreuz, where <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>some Austrian Catholic missionaries
have founded a settlement.&nbsp; Remaining there until the 15th
of September, Alexina Tinn&eacute; made a short excursion into
the interior, crossing rivers, traversing forests, and meeting
with numerous villages, half hidden in leafiness.</p>
<p>As the voyagers approached Gondokoro, they observed that the
panoramas assumed a grander character; that the landscapes were
on a loftier scale.&nbsp; Tropical forests extended their deep
shades along the river banks; and sometimes in their recesses it
was possible to catch sight of the remains of ancient buildings,
at one time, perhaps, inhabited by a busy race.&nbsp; Gondokoro,
long regarded as the <i>Ultima Thule</i> of the Nile Valley, was
reached on the 30th of September.&nbsp; It proved to be the
extreme southward limit of Alexina Tinn&eacute;&rsquo;s
explorations.&nbsp; She ardently longed to advance&mdash;to share
some of the glory resting upon the names of Speke and Grant,
Baker and Petherick&mdash;to see with her own eyes the immense
basin of the Victorian Sea&mdash;to trace to its well-head the
course of the Nile; but the obstacles thrown in her way proved
insurmountable.&nbsp; Moreover, most of her followers were seized
with malarious fever, and she herself had an attack, which for
some days held her life in danger.&nbsp; When she recovered, she
began to study the habits and manners of the native tribes
residing in the neighbourhood of Gondokoro.&nbsp; They are all
Baris, and very ignorant and superstitious, but not naturally
cruel.&nbsp; No trade flourishes among them like that of the
sorcerer, who is also the medicine-man.&nbsp; When a Bari falls
ill, he hastens to consult the Punok, who gives him some absurd
but <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>infallible recipe, and the cure is effected!&nbsp; One
of these magicians succeeded in persuading the negroes that he
was invulnerable.&nbsp; Oxen, sheep, and presents of all kinds
were poured into his willing hands; but unluckily he declaimed
against the expeditions of the Egyptians, who, not having any
sense of humour, put him to death.&nbsp; His dupes, gathering
round his dead body, waited patiently for his resurrection; and
only began to doubt when the corpse putrefied.</p>
<p>Among the Bari sorcerers a high rank is held by the
&ldquo;rain-maker&rdquo;&mdash;a personage of great repute, to
whom the villagers bring oxen, fruits, and trinkets, in days of
drought, to bribe him to invoke the clouds and their treasures of
fertilizing rain.&nbsp; But his position is not without its
inconveniences; if, after the performance of his rites, the
drought continues, the people assemble at his house, drag him
forth, and without more ado, cut open the stomach of the
unfortunate Kodjour, on the plea that the storms must be shut up
in it, as they make no external manifestation.&nbsp; Few are the
years in which one of these rain-makers does not perish, unless
he has the wit to escape out of danger before his deception is
discovered.</p>
<p>From Gondokoro Alexina Tinn&eacute; returned without delay to
Khart&ucirc;m, where she received the congratulations of the
European community; but her rest was not of long duration.&nbsp;
She had nothing of the lotos-eater in her temperament, and could
find contentment only in action.&nbsp; Hers was the true
traveller&rsquo;s character&mdash;energetic, active, daring,
tenacious, with an insatiable thirst for new scenes.&nbsp;
Thwarted in her first design, she immediately took up
another.&nbsp; She would ascend the great western <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>tributary
of the Nile, the Bahr-el-Ghazal, explore the streams which feed
it, and penetrate into the land of the Nyam-nyam, of whom Doctor
Heughlin has furnished so interesting an account.&nbsp; Her
preparations were soon completed.&nbsp; This time she and her
mother&mdash;her aunt remained at Khart&ucirc;m&mdash;did not
travel alone; their expedition was reinforced by three
experienced travellers, Doctor Heughlin, the naturalist, Doctor
Steudner, and Baron d&rsquo;Ablaing.&nbsp; The first two started
in advance, so as to open up the route for the adventurous
Alexina, who, with her mother and Baron d&rsquo;Ablaing, quitted
Khart&ucirc;m at the end of February, 1863, in command of a
flotilla composed of a steamer, a sailing-vessel, and several
small boats.</p>
<p>Heughlin, who had set out some days before, passed, on the
31st of January, the Gebel Tefafan, a lofty mountain which rises
at no great distance from the river.&nbsp; He reached Lake
N&ucirc;&mdash;a point from which the voyager has more than two
hundred miles to accomplish across the Bahr-el-Ghazal.&nbsp; At
that time of the year the river in many places is as narrow as a
canal, though on both sides bordered by a swampy plain, which
stretches further than the eye can see, and bears a thick growth
of gigantic reeds.&nbsp; At other places it deepens into
considerable lakes.</p>
<p>The natives navigate it in light canoes, which they manage
with much dexterity.&nbsp; They sit astride the stem, with their
legs hanging down in the water; and if they fall in with no
branches capable of being converted into oars, they row with
their hands.&nbsp; The Nouers, who inhabit this land of marsh and
morass, furnish an apparent exemplification of the Darwinian <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>theory: by
a process of natural selection they have become thoroughly
adapted to the conditions of a soil and climate which would
rapidly kill off an unaccustomed population.&nbsp; Their muscular
strength is remarkable; and they are a race of Anaks, averaging
from six to seven feet in height.&nbsp; Alexina Tinn&eacute;
records that, in spite of the heat of a tropical sun, and the
attacks of swarms of insects, they would stand erect, with lance
in hand, on the summit of the mounds thrown up by termites,
anxiously watching the steamer and the boats in tow as they
passed by swiftly and steadily, against wave and current&mdash;a
type, shall we say? of the irresistible progress of
civilization.</p>
<p>While Doctor Heughlin, in the true scientific spirit,
industriously explored the banks of the Bahr-el-Ghazal, Alexina
Tinn&eacute; was making a persistent effort to rejoin him.&nbsp;
Innumerable difficulties assailed her.&nbsp; When only a few
miles from Khart&ucirc;m, her captain came to tell her, with
signs of the utmost terror, that the steamer was leaking, and
would shortly sink.&nbsp; Her alarm may easily be imagined; but
fortunately she was never wanting in presence of mind.&nbsp; She
gave orders that the cargo should be immediately unloaded; the
leak was repaired, and the voyage resumed.&nbsp; A few hours
later, and the vessel was again in danger, the water rushing in
with greater violence than before.&nbsp; A close investigation
was made, and then it was discovered that the pilot and captain
had each agreed to bore a hole in the ship&rsquo;s hull, with the
view of putting a stop to a voyage which they, as well as the
crew, dreaded.&nbsp; But our heroine was not to be
conquered.&nbsp; She at once dismissed a part of the crew, <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>and sent
away both the captain and the pilot; then, with men pledged to be
true to her, she sailed away resolutely for the
Bahr-el-Ghazal.</p>
<p>At first, she made but slow progress, on account of the mass
of tall dense grasses and aquatic plants that choked up the
stream.&nbsp; In many places it was necessary to clear a way for
the steamer with knife and axe.&nbsp; In the sun-baked mud grisly
crocodiles swarmed; the snort of the hippopotamus rose from amid
the reedy tangle; the elephant with calm eyes watched the
movements of the strangers.&nbsp; The swamps of the
Bahr-el-Ghazal are a paradise of wild beasts, and Mademoiselle
Tinn&eacute; saw thousands of them wandering to and fro.&nbsp;
But though game is so abundant, to hunt it is very
difficult.&nbsp; The sportsman cannot penetrate into the midst of
the dry and withered vegetation without a crackling of leaves and
a snapping of stems, which give instant alarm to vigilant and
suspicious ears.&nbsp; No sooner does he set foot in the jungle,
than, as if warned by some secret telegraphic agency, all its
denizens take to flight.&nbsp; But while Mademoiselle
Tinn&eacute;&rsquo;s followers were vainly attempting to pursue
the trail of the great pachyderms, a huge elephant, which had
probably entered too far into the river in the keenness of his
thirst, was caught up in the current, and driven against one of
the boats.&nbsp; The opportunity was not neglected; the boatmen
immediately assailed the unfortunate animal, killed it, and cut
it in pieces.</p>
<p>Lake Reg is the highest navigable point of the Ghazal. <a
name="citation249"></a><a href="#footnote249"
class="citation">[249]</a>&nbsp; Our heroine found here a fleet
of five and <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>twenty craft, some with cargoes of ivory, others with
cargoes of dourra or millet.&nbsp; She was received with
enthusiasm, which specially manifested itself in the discharge of
three volleys of musketry&mdash;a compliment to which Alexina
Tinn&eacute; replied by hoisting the Dutch flag.</p>
<p>As soon as her little flotilla was safely moored among the
trading craft, the enterprising lady prepared to undertake a
journey into the interior.&nbsp; But as it was found impossible
to collect a sufficient number of porters to carry the baggage,
she arranged that Doctors Heughlin and Steudner should start in
search of suitable winter-quarters.&nbsp; The two travellers set
out, but the malarious climate broke down their health, and both
were seized with a dangerous marsh fever.&nbsp; They suffered
greatly; but, sustained by their strong will, they pushed
forward, crossing, on the 2nd of April, the river Djur, and
arriving, the same evening, at the village of Wau.&nbsp; Here
Doctor Steudner rapidly grew worse.&nbsp; Before long he was
unable to walk; he fell into a profound stupor, and passed away,
almost without pain, on the 10th of April.&nbsp; Doctor Heughlin
describes, with much pathos, the feelings of grief and melancholy
which overpowered him when he buried his friend.&nbsp; The body
was wrapped in Abyssinian cloth and covered with leaves; then
interred in a deep trench dug at the foot of a clump of
trees.</p>
<p>On the 17th of April, Doctor Heughlin quitted the lonely
shades of Wau, and, having lured a large number of porters,
returned to Lake Reg.&nbsp; Then, to complete the necessary
arrangements for the projected expedition to the country of the
Nyam-nyam, <a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>Baron d&rsquo;Ablaing went on a trip to Khart&ucirc;m,
whence he brought back an abundant supply of provisions.&nbsp;
During his absence, Alexina Tinn&eacute; was visited by Mrs.
Petherick, the wife of the English consul&mdash;a woman not less
courageous than herself, who had accompanied her husband in most
of his explorations.&nbsp; She claims the honour of having added
numerous places to the map of Africa, and of having been the
first European lady who had penetrated into those remote
regions.</p>
<p>While Alexina Tinn&eacute; represents Holland, and Mrs.
Petherick England, Germany is represented by the wife of Sir
Samuel Baker, to whom allusion has already been made.&nbsp; A
woman of delicate and even feeble appearance, with a countenance
of remarkable amiability of expression; she possesses, as Queen
Elizabeth said of herself, &ldquo;the heart of a man,&rdquo; and
of a brave and chivalrous man.&nbsp; Deeds worthy of the most
famous knights have been accomplished by this lady, who, it might
have been thought, would have sunk before the first breath of the
Simoom.&nbsp; One may here be recorded.&nbsp; While out hunting,
Sir Samuel Baker was attacked by a buffalo, which had sprung upon
him unperceived through the high thick grasses, and was on the
point of impaling him on its horns, when Lady Baker, with cool
and steady aim, raised her rifle, and lodging a bullet between
the animal&rsquo;s eyes, stretched it dead on the ground.&nbsp; A
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, the slightest wavering or nervousness,
and Sir Samuel would have been lost.</p>
<p>Alexina Tinn&eacute;, with Mr. and Mrs. Petherick, made
numerous excursions in the neighbourhood of Lake Reg, in one of
which they were surprised by a <a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>terrible storm.&nbsp; In the memory
of living man no such hurricane had been known; and it seemed to
spend its worst fury upon the traveller&rsquo;s caravan, which it
threatened every moment to sweep from the earth.&nbsp; When it
had somewhat subsided, other difficulties arose.&nbsp; The
soldiers who formed the escort were not only inveterately idle,
but irrepressibly dishonest; while as for the negroes, they were
contumacious, and refused to follow the route indicated by their
employer.&nbsp; A serious disturbance was on the point of
breaking out, when the gale returned with fresh violence, tore
down at least half of the encampment, and almost suffocated
Alexina Tinn&eacute; amidst the wreckage of her hut.&nbsp; While
it lasted, terror prevented her followers from resorting to acts
of open insubordination; but they regained their audacity as the
tempest passed away, and, declaring that their supply of food was
insufficient, demanded larger rations.&nbsp; A general mutiny
seemed imminent; but the fair leader of the expedition was equal
to the occasion.&nbsp; Though suffering from bodily pain and
weakness, she boldly confronted the insurgents; with flashing
eye, and in a fierce voice, addressed to them a severe reprimand,
and ordered them to lay down their arms.&nbsp; Her intrepid
demeanour awed them into submission, and the encounter ended in
their humbly supplicating her forgiveness.</p>
<p>The crisis over, her overwrought system gave way.&nbsp; So
serious was her illness that at one time recovery seemed
impossible, and the deepest sorrow was manifested by the whole
camp.&nbsp; Quinine, however, which is the sheet-anchor (so to
speak) of African travellers, saved her.&nbsp; A gradual
improvement took <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>place, and by the 30th of May all danger had
disappeared.</p>
<p>As soon as she was able to move, she gave orders for the
expedition to advance.&nbsp; It travelled by short stages; and
when, towards night, Miss Tinn&eacute; came upon a village which
promised convenient quarters, she sent for the sheikh, and the
gift of a few beads was sufficient to make him expel from their
huts the native families.&nbsp; Without striking a blow, the
travellers got possession of the place, and in a few hours had
settled themselves comfortably, while taking due care of their
camels and cattle.&nbsp; As for the dispossessed inhabitants,
they were left to find what shelter or accommodation they could,
consoling themselves with the promise of ample compensation on
the morrow.</p>
<p>The African villages are sometimes of considerable size.&nbsp;
They are nearly always surrounded by a belt of cultivated ground,
where dourra, sesamum, and culinary vegetables grow in
profusion.&nbsp; The flocks scattered over the pastures often
include some thousands of sheep, though they are never killed by
the natives for purposes of food.&nbsp; Miss Tinn&eacute;
purchased several; but as soon as it was known that she
slaughtered them for provision, their owners refused to
sell.&nbsp; The natives apparently make the sheep the object of a
superstitious <i>cultus</i>, as the Lapps do the hare.&nbsp; It
is true, however, that their scruples vanished at the sight of
Alexina Tinn&eacute;&rsquo;s trinkets; their religion proved
unable to withstand the temptation of a bright ring or glittering
bracelet.&nbsp; Yet who shall blame them when Christians have
been known to forswear their faith for equally small <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>bribes?&nbsp; It is a curious fact that each tribe has
its favourite colour&mdash;that while one swears by blue beads,
another has eyes only for green; so that a tribe which will
violate its conscience for a handful of blue beads or yellow,
will preserve it intact if tested by beads of any other
colour.&nbsp; But no bribe is so powerful, will prevail over so
many vows, will appease so many scruples, as a piece of blue or
red cotton.&nbsp; This, however, was reserved as a gratification
for the chiefs alone; and it was a sight to make you laugh or
weep, according as your philosophy is that of Democritus or
Heraclitus, to see them strutting through their villages, proud
as peacocks in their gaudy attire, haughtier than a mayor with
his official chain round his portly chest, happier than a
Frenchman with the ribbon of the Legion of Honour in his
button-hole.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The countries of Djur and D&ouml;r, traversed by our caravan,
offered a succession of the most varied panoramas.&nbsp; For
several days it passed through marshy lowlands, covered with a
coarse hard grass: the herbage was besprinkled with rare flowers,
many of which belonged to species unknown to European
botanists.&nbsp; As they advanced trees became more numerous;
groves developed into woods, and woods expanded into a luxurious
forest, where the eye surveyed with delight a rich network of
climbing plants and wild vines, spreading from tree to tree,
while the dense cloud of verdure was lighted up profusely with
starry blossoms.&nbsp; In this happy land the mosquito was never
found; nor were there any injurious insects, except the termites
or white ants.</p>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>The
picture suddenly changed as the travellers penetrated further
into the interior; immense plains stretched away to a remote
horizon, where earth and heaven seemed to mingle.&nbsp;
Occasionally, however, the monotonous level was broken pleasantly
by clumps of graceful trees, forming so many isles of greenery,
in which the calm bland air was perfumed by the sweet odours that
rose, like a breath, from magnificent cactuses, orchids, and
irises.&nbsp; Thousands of birds, surprised among the tall
grasses by the passing caravan, sprang aloft and filled the air
with the whir of winnowing wings.</p>
<p>Enraptured by the beauty of this fortunate and favoured
region, Alexina forgot the sufferings she had endured, and,
giving a free rein to her womanly enthusiasm,
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;This is a delightful country, a marvellous
land, which compensates us for all our fatigue; yes, and for all
our outlay!&rdquo;&nbsp; These last words may be considered as a
striking example of bathos, or &ldquo;the art of sinking,&rdquo;
considering the circumstances under which they were pronounced;
but it would appear that the enormous expenses of the expedition
had by this time made a serious inroad even on Miss
Tinn&eacute;&rsquo;s large fortune.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As for some years a marked diminution had taken place in the
number of elephants inhabiting the valley of the White Nile, the
ivory dealers pushed forward into the countries watered by the
Bahr-el-Ghazal and the Djur.&nbsp; There they found themselves in
a virgin region, which hitherto had not been contaminated by the
influences of a corrupt civilization.&nbsp; It was a mine to be
worked with the happiest results, <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>and accordingly they established a
series of stations, each in charge of a vakil or manager.&nbsp;
In the month of November these were visited in person by the
traders, who loaded their boats with ivory, too frequently adding
to their cargoes of elephants&rsquo; tusks the unfortunate
negroes who had served them as guides and hunters.&nbsp; As time
went on, they extended their relations, and gave free course to
their ambition.&nbsp; They armed the tribes one against another,
promoted internecine contests, and in this way consolidated their
cruel and unscrupulous despotism.</p>
<p>Our travellers nearly fell victims to one of these infamous
speculators in the blood of the feeble and defenceless.&nbsp;
Yielding to his repeated pressure, Alexina and her followers
advanced to Bongo, where he exercised authority.&nbsp; They were
received with a splendid welcome.&nbsp; On their arrival volleys
of musketry woke all the surrounding echoes.&nbsp; Biselli (such
was the name of their self-appointed host) met them at the
entrance to the village, and conducted them into a spacious and
convenient habitation, where, with the most courteous attention,
they were served with sherbet, coffee, and other refreshing
drinks.&nbsp; No one was forgotten in his profuse hospitality;
masters and servants were entertained with equal
liberality.&nbsp; The abrek, the delicious beer of the country,
was freely circulated among the people, and generously
distributed to the very porters.</p>
<p>As Biselli was absolute master in the village and its
neighbourhood, and owned almost everything, Alexina Tinn&eacute;
requested him to sell some corn and oxen.&nbsp; He answered, like
a true gentleman, that for twenty-four hours he was her host;
that he <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>had abdicated his position as a trader, and had no
thought but her comfort, and to give her an honourable
reception.&nbsp; His profuseness, far from diminishing, largely
increased; and his European guests were almost ashamed to be the
recipients of an hospitality so cordial, so unlimited, and so
unexpected.</p>
<p>But unfortunately a change came over the spirit of the
dream.&nbsp; Next day, clouds gathered on the horizon which had
previously been so fair.&nbsp; The travellers wished to hire a
small zoriba, or plantation, comprising two tents.&nbsp; Biselli
named thirty thalers as the price.&nbsp; No objection was
offered, and Miss Tinn&eacute;&rsquo;s people began to store the
baggage, when he suddenly made a demand for two hundred
thalers.&nbsp; This exorbitant sum was promptly and firmly
refused; he then reduced it to forty thalers, which was
paid.&nbsp; Soon afterwards the caravan was in need of dourra,
and there was no help for it but to apply to Biselli.&nbsp; Well
aware of their necessity, the scoundrel charged forty times more
than they would have had to pay at Khart&ucirc;m, and on every
other article he put in like manner a tax of forty or fifty per
cent.&nbsp; The ex-gentleman had resumed his old character as an
unprincipled speculator.</p>
<p>Our travellers, however, felt that they could no longer endure
his impositions, and abandoning Bongo and Biselli, returned to
Lake Reg.&nbsp; Here Alexina&rsquo;s mother was seized with an
illness which carried her off in a few days (July 23rd).&nbsp;
Two European servants were also attacked by fever, and succumbed
to its fatal influence.&nbsp; Overwhelmed with grief, Miss
Tinn&eacute; abandoned her schemes of African exploration, and <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>slowly and
with difficulty made her way back to Khart&ucirc;m, to find that
her aunt, the Baroness van Capellan, had died during her absence
(in May, 1864).&nbsp; As soon as she had recruited her strength,
she removed to Cairo, where she took up her residence, and for
four years made a conspicuous figure in its brilliant European
circle.</p>
<p>The love of new scenes, however, had not been quenched by her
adventures, and in her yacht she made frequent visits to Naples
and Rome, Smyrna and Jaffa, Algiers and Tripoli.&nbsp; While at
the latter port, a caravan arrived from the Sahara, with the
products of the rich lands that lie beyond that famous
desert.&nbsp; The incident suggested to her bold imagination the
idea of an expedition which in romance and interest should
eclipse her previous enterprise, and she traced the plan of a
journey across Tripoli to the capital of Fezzan, thence to Kuka,
and westward, by way of Wadai, Darfur, and Kordofan, to the
Nile.&nbsp; As this route would carry her into the territory of
the brave but treacherous Towaregs, a race to whom plunder and
rapine seem the breath of life, she took care to provide herself
with a sufficient escort, and on the 29th of January, 1869, set
out from Tripoli at the head of a troop of fifty armed men.&nbsp;
At Sokna, in Fezzan, which she reached on the 1st of March, she
engaged the services of a Towareg chief, one Ik-nu-ken; but at
the last moment he failed her, and she accepted as guides two
chiefs of the same tribe, who professed to have been sent by
Ik-nu-ken.&nbsp; These men, in conjunction with her attendant,
Mohammed, a Tunisian, resolved upon murdering her in order to
gain possession of her money and valuables.&nbsp; Soon <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>after her
departure from Sokna (it was on the 1st of August) they excited a
quarrel among the camel-drivers, and when Alexina quitted her
tent to ascertain the cause, one of the Towaregs shot her with a
rifle-bullet, mortally wounding her.&nbsp; For four and twenty
hours she lay dying at the door of her tent, no one venturing to
offer assistance or consolation.</p>
<p>Such was the melancholy fate of Alexina Tinn&eacute;!&nbsp; It
is satisfactory to know that the murderers who, with their
plunder, had escaped into the interior, were eventually captured,
tried, and sentenced to imprisonment for life. <a

<h2><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>MR.
J. A. MACGAHAN,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND CAMPAIGNING ON THE OXUS.</span></h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. J. A. Macgahan</span>, as special
correspondent for the <i>New York Herald</i>, a journal well
known by the liberality and boldness of its management,
accompanied the Russian army, under General Kauffmann, in its
campaigns in Central Asia in 1873 and 1874.</p>
<p>Bound for the seat of war, he made his way, in company with
Mr. Eugene Schuyler, the American <i>charg&eacute;
d&rsquo;affaires</i> at St. Petersburg, who desired to see
something of Central Asia, to Kasala, a Russian town on the
Syr-Daria (the ancient <i>Jaxartes</i>), where he arrived in
April, 1873.&nbsp; He describes this town, or fort, as the
entering wedge of the Russians into Central Asia.&nbsp; Its
population, exclusive of Russian soldiers and civilians, consists
of Sarts, or Tadjiks, Bokhariots, Kirghiz, and Kara-Kalpaks; all
being Tartar tribes, in whom an infusion of Aryan blood has more
or less modified the old Mongolian type.&nbsp; As for the town,
it is picturesque enough to a European eye&mdash;its low mud
houses, with flat roofs, windowless, and almost doorless; its
baz&aacute;r, where long-bearded men, in bright-coloured robes,
gravely drink tea among the wares that crowd their little shops;
and <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>the
strings of laden camels that stalk through its streets,
presenting a novel combination.&nbsp; As soon as he had obtained
all the information he could with respect to the movements of the
Russian force, Mr. MacGahan resolved on making a dash for the
Oxus, hoping to reach that river before General Kauffmann&rsquo;s
army had crossed it.&nbsp; But when the Russian authorities
learned his design, they at once interfered, declaring that the
journey was dangerous, if not impracticable, and must not be
undertaken without leave from the Governor-General.&nbsp; Mr.
MacGahan then resolved on pushing forward to Fort Perovsky, as if
going only to Tashkent; trusting to find there an officer in
command who would not be troubled by such conscientious scruples
about his personal safety.&nbsp; No objection was made to a
journey to Tashkent; Mr. MacGahan and Mr. Schuyler therefore
hurried their preparations, stowed their baggage in a waggon, and
themselves in a tarantass, and shaking the dust off their feet at
inhospitable and suspicious Kasala, took their course along the
banks of the Syr-Daria.</p>
<p>This, the ancient Jaxartes, is one of the most eccentric of
rivers.&nbsp; It is continually changing its bed, like a restless
traveller; &ldquo;here to-day, and gone to-morrow,&rdquo; and
gone a distance of some eight to ten miles.&nbsp; To adapt it to
the purposes of navigation seems almost impossible, or, at all
events, would be unprofitable; and the best use that could be
made of its waters would be to irrigate with them the thirsty
sands of the desert of Kyzil-Kum.</p>
<p>On Mr. MacGahan&rsquo;s arrival at Fort Perovsky, he proceeded
to engage a guide and horses, having fully resolved to carry out
his bold enterprise.&nbsp; From the <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>commandant he was fortunate enough
to obtain a passport, and on the 30th of April he bade farewell
to Mr. Schuyler, and set out.&nbsp; His <i>cort&eacute;ge</i>
consisted of Ak-Mamatoff, his Tartar servant, Mushuf, the guide,
and a young Kirghiz attendant, all mounted, with ten horses to
carry the baggage and forage.&nbsp; As a man of peace, he says,
he went but lightly armed.&nbsp; Yet a heavy double-barrelled
hunting rifle, a double-barrelled shot gun (both being
breech-loaders), an eighteen-shooter Winchester rifle, three
heavy revolvers, and one ordinary muzzle-loading shot gun
throwing slugs, together with a few knives and sabres, would seem
to make up a tolerable arsenal!&nbsp; Mr. MacGahan, however,
assures us that he did not contemplate fighting, and that he
encumbered himself with these &ldquo;lethal weapons&rdquo; only
that he might be able to discuss with becoming dignity questions
concerning the rights of way and of property, on which his
opinions might differ from those of the nomads of the desert, who
hold to Rob Roy&rsquo;s good old rule, that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They should take who have the power,<br />
And they should keep who can.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That night our traveller accepted the hospitality of a
Kirghiz.&nbsp; Next morning he and his men were in the saddle by
sunrise, riding merrily away to the south-west, across a country
innocent of road or path.&nbsp; Sometimes their course lay
through tangled brushwood, sometimes through tall reeds which
completely concealed each rider from his companions, sometimes
over low sandy dunes, and sometimes across a bare and most
desolate plain.&nbsp; Occasionally they heard the loud sharp cry
of the golden pheasant of Turkistan; <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>then they would pass large flocks
and herds of sheep, cattle, and horses, quietly grazing; and
again they would meet and salute a Kirghiz shepherd on
horseback.&nbsp; To eyes that have been trained to <i>see</i> no
desert can be utterly barren of interest; the vigilant observer
will discover, in the most sterile waste, something of fresh and
novel character, something suggestive of thick-coming
fancies.&nbsp; For example, Mr. MacGahan noted the remarkable
difference between the wide stretches of the sandy plain and the
occasional streaks of ground that had been under recent
cultivation; and he perceived that the desert had the
advantage.&nbsp; Parched and sun-scorched, and without a trace of
vegetation, was the land that had been irrigated only the year
before; while the desert assumed a delicate tint of green, with
its budding brushwood and thin grass, which always springs into
life as soon as the snow melts, to flourish until stricken sore
by the heats of summer.</p>
<p>At nightfall the travellers, weary with eleven hours&rsquo;
ride, drew up at a Kara-Kalpak aul, or encampment, consisting of
a dozen kibitkas, pitched near a little pond in the centre of a
delightful oasis.&nbsp; The owner of one of the kibitkas proved
to be the guide&rsquo;s brother, and gave the party a cordial
welcome.&nbsp; The Kara-Kalpaks are nomads like the Kirghiz, but
though they live side by side with them, and frequently
intermarry, they seem to belong to a different race of men.&nbsp;
They are taller than the Kirghiz, and well-made; their skin is
almost as white as that of a European; and instead of the small
eyes, high cheek-bones, flat noses, thick lips, and round
beardless faces of the Kirghiz, they have long faces, high noses,
large open eyes, and are bearded &ldquo;like the pard.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>&ldquo;After supper,&rdquo; says Mr. MacGahan, &ldquo;I
stepped outside the tent to take a look on the surrounding scene,
and enjoy the cool air of the evening.&nbsp; The new moon was
just setting; lights were gleaming in every direction over the
plain, showing that ours was not the only aul in the
vicinity.&nbsp; The bleating of sheep and the lowing of cattle
could be heard, mingled with the playful bark of dogs and the
laughing voices of children, which came to us on the still
evening air like music.&nbsp; In places the weeds and grass of
last year had been fired to clear the ground for the new growth,
and broad sheets of fire crawled slowly forward over the plain,
while huge volumes of dense smoke, that caught the light of the
flames below, rolled along the sky in grotesque fantastic shapes
like clouds of fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kibitka, according to our traveller, is made up of
numerous thin strips of wood, six feet long, which are fastened
loosely together like a vine trellis, and can be opened out or
folded up compactly, as necessity requires.&nbsp; As the strips
are slightly curved in the middle, the framework, when expanded,
naturally takes the form of a segment of a circle.&nbsp; Four of
these frames constitute the skeleton sides of the tent; and on
their tops are placed some twenty or thirty rafters, properly
curved, with their upper ends inserted in the hoop, three or four
feet in diameter, that serves as a roof-tree.&nbsp; The method of
pitching a kibitka may be thus described:&mdash;As soon as the
camel with the felt and framework reaches the chosen site, he is
made to kneel down, and a couple of women seize the framework,
which they straightway set up on end, and extend in the form of a
circle.&nbsp; <a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>Next the doorposts are planted, and the whole bound
firmly together with a camel&rsquo;s-hair rope.&nbsp; Then one of
the women takes the afore-mentioned wooden hoop, and raising it
above her head on a pole, the other proceeds to insert in their
proper holes the twenty or thirty rafters, fastening their basis
to the lower framework by means of hoops.&nbsp; When a thick fold
of felt has been let down over the framework, the kibitka, which
measures about fifteen feet in diameter, and eight feet in
length, is complete.&nbsp; In appearance it is not unlike a
magnified beehive of the old pattern.</p>
<p>The Kirghiz nomads are fierce, crafty, often cruel, but they
hold the life of a guest sacred.&nbsp; For his property, however,
they have no such high consideration, and they are not above the
temptation of plundering him of any article that attracts their
fancy.&nbsp; Their chief amusements are horse exercises and
falconry.&nbsp; They love the chase with a true sportsman&rsquo;s
passion; loving it for itself, rather than for the game it
procures, as they can conceive of nothing daintier than a dish of
mutton&mdash;a dish which they prepare with touching
simplicity.&nbsp; For, a sheep having been skinned, they cut it
into quarters, which they plunge into a large caldron of water,
and boil for a couple of hours.&nbsp; Generally, on a principle
of severe economy, they cook the intestines with the meat, not
taking the trouble even to separate them.&nbsp; The guests
arrange themselves in a circle on carpets of felt; the men, as
recognized lords of the creation, occupying the foremost places,
the women and children sitting in the rear.&nbsp; The smoking
quarters of mutton are removed from the pot; each man draws his
knife, slashes off a cantle, eats until satisfied, and <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>passes what
is left to his wife and children, who speedily effect a
clearance.&nbsp; The dogs come in for the bones.&nbsp;
Afterwards, bowls of the liquor in which the meat has been boiled
are handed round, and not a Kirghiz but swallows the greasy
potion with as much zest as an epicure takes his glass of dry
champagne.&nbsp; This broth, koumis (fermented mare&rsquo;s
milk), and tea, are his customary liquors; but the tea, instead
of being prepared in the European fashion, is made into a kind of
soup with milk, flour, butter, and salt.&nbsp; In every
respectable Kirghiz kibitka the women keep constantly upon the
fire a vessel of this beverage, which they offer to visitors,
just as a Turk serves up coffee, and a Spaniard chocolate.</p>
<p>In their mode of life the Kirghiz display a certain
originality.&nbsp; They spend the three winter months in mud huts
on the bank of a river or a small stream, and resume their annual
migrations as soon as the snow begins to melt.&nbsp; During these
migrations they live in tents, and never halt in one spot for
longer than three days.&nbsp; Their march is often continued
until they have travelled three or four hundred miles; then they
turn round, and retrace the same route, so as to reach their
place of hibernation before the snow falls.&nbsp; In their
selection of quarters they seem guided by some traditions handed
down in the different auls; and not unfrequently a body of
Kirghiz will pass over much excellent grazing ground, and travel
many a league to inferior pasturage.&nbsp; The hardships they
undergo are so many, their pleasures so few and mean, their
objects so commonplace, that one is tempted to wonder what kind
of answer an intelligent Kirghiz would return to the question not
<a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>long ago
put with some emphasis before the reading public, &ldquo;Is life
worth living?&rdquo;&nbsp; Those higher motives, those purer
aspirations which the cultivated European mind delights to
recognize, are unknown to the wild nomad, and he spends day after
day, and month after month, in what would seem to be a drearily
monotonous struggle for existence, under conditions which might
be supposed to render existence an intolerable burden.&nbsp; But
then he can love and suffer as we know civilized men and women
love and suffer; and love and suffering will invest the harshest,
coarsest life with a certain grace and consecration.</p>
<p>There was once a young Kirghiz, named Polat, who was affianced
to Muna Aim, the comeliest maiden in the aul, or community, of
Tugluk.&nbsp; Her father, Ish Djan, had received the customary
kalym, or wedding present, and the marriage day had been
appointed.&nbsp; But before it arrived, &ldquo;the blind fury
with the abhorred shears&rdquo; had &ldquo;slit&rdquo;
Polat&rsquo;s &ldquo;thin-spun life;&rdquo; and Muna Aim was set
free from her promise.&nbsp; Suluk, Polat&rsquo;s brother, came
forward, however, and, in his anxiety to recover his
brother&rsquo;s property, which she had received as her dower,
claimed her as his wife.&nbsp; The claim was supported by her
father; but Muna Aim, who had sufficient means to live on,
considered herself a widow, and refused to marry.&nbsp; She was
driven from her father&rsquo;s kibitka; and taking her camel,
with her sheep and goats, her clothes and carpets, she bought a
little kibitka for herself, and lived alone, but not
unhappy.&nbsp; For her heart was really with Azim, a young
Kirghiz belonging to another aul, and she had consented to marry
Polat only in obedience to her father.&nbsp; A second <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>sacrifice
she was determined not to make.&nbsp; But the old women grew very
angry with Muna Aim, as she continued to enjoy her
independence.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the matter with her?&rdquo;
they cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;She will not go to her husband, but
lives alone like an outlaw.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was an innovator,
boldly breaking through a traditional custom, and they resolved
to &ldquo;reason&rdquo; with her.&nbsp; Their arguments were
those which the strong too often employ against the feeble; they
hurled at her bad names, and they scratched her face and pulled
her hair.&nbsp; Still she would not yield; and in contentment she
milked her sheep and goats, drove them to the pasture, and drew
water for them from the well, waiting for some happy turn of
fortune which might unite her with her Azim.</p>
<p>At last Suluk also resolved to try the effect of
&ldquo;reason.&rdquo;&nbsp; With three or four friends he
repaired one night to her kibitka, and broke it open, resolved to
carry her off to his tent, and compel her to be his wife.&nbsp;
Love and despair, however, lent her so wonderful an energy, that
she resisted all their efforts.&nbsp; They dragged her to the
door; but she clutched at the door-posts with her hands, and held
so firmly, that to make her let go they were forced to draw their
knives and slash her fingers.&nbsp; When they succeeded in
hauling her into the open air, her clothes were torn from her
body, and she was covered with blood from head to foot.&nbsp; She
continued her brave struggle; and Suluk, leaping on his horse and
catching her by her beautiful long hair, dragged her at his
horse&rsquo;s heels, until it came out by the roots, and he was
compelled to leave her on the ground, naked, bleeding, half
dead.</p>
<p>Information of this outrage, however, reached the <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>Yarim-Padshah (or &ldquo;half emperor&rdquo;), as the
tribes of Central Asia call the redoubtable General Kauffmann;
and he despatched a party of Cossacks to seize its author.&nbsp;
Suluk was speedily captured, and sent, a prisoner, to Siberia;
while the faithful and courageous Muna Aim recovered her health
and her braids of long dark hair, and in the winter met the lover
for whom she had endured so much, and was happily married.</p>
<p>Thus the reader will perceive that romance flourishes even in
the wildernesses of the Kyzil-Kum; and that a Kirghiz woman can
be elevated by a true love like an English maiden.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Continuing his ride after the Russians, Mr. MacGahan, when
near Irkibai, came upon the ruins of an ancient city.&nbsp; It
had once been about three miles in circumference, walled, and on
three sides surrounded by a wide and deep canal, on the fourth by
the Yani-Daria.&nbsp; The wall had been strengthened by
watch-towers, and on the summit of a hill in the centre stood two
towers thirty to forty feet in height.&nbsp; The whole was built
of sun-dried brick, and was fast crumbling into shapeless
mounds.&nbsp; At Irkibai Mr. MacGahan met with every courtesy
from the commandant, but nothing was known of the whereabouts of
General Kauffmann.&nbsp; There were but two courses before the
traveller&mdash;to return, or go forward.&nbsp; Mr. MacGahan was
not the man to retrace his steps until his work was done, if it
were possible to do it; and he resolved on continuing his
progress to the Oxus.&nbsp; On the 7th of May he rode
forward.&nbsp; At first he followed the regular caravan route,
which, as <a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>many traces showed, had also been that of the Russian
division, under the Grand-Duke Nicholas.&nbsp; It crosses the
thirsty desert&mdash;twenty leagues without a well.&nbsp; Fair
enough is it to the eye, with its rolling lines of verdant hills;
but the hills are only sand, and the verdure consists of a coarse
soft weed that, when it flowers, exhales a most offensive
odour.&nbsp; Beneath the broad leaves lurk scorpions and
tarantulas, great lizards, beetles, and serpents.&nbsp; The
traveller, if he lose his way in this deadly waste of delusion,
may wander to and fro for days, until he and his horse sink
exhausted, to perish of thirst, with no other covering for their
bones than the rank and noxious herbage.</p>
<p>Across the gleaming burning sands, while the sun smote them
pitilessly with his burning arrows, rode our brave traveller and
his companions.&nbsp; Their lips cracked with thirst, and their
eyes smarted with the noontide glare, and their weary horses
stumbled in the loose shifting soil; but rest they durst not
until they reached the well of Kyzil-Kak.&nbsp; How glad they
were to throw themselves down beside it, while some kindly
Kirghiz, who had already refreshed their camels and horses, drew
for them the welcome water!&nbsp; MacGahan made a short halt
here, feeding his horses, and sharing with his attendants a light
meal of biscuits and fresh milk, supplied by the Kirghiz, and
then&mdash;the saddle again!&nbsp; Meeting with a caravan, he
learned from its Bashi, or leader, that the Russian army was at
Tamdy&mdash;that is, instead of being, as he had hoped, within a
day&rsquo;s march, it must be upwards of two hundred miles
distant; and as it was just on the point of starting for <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>Aristan-Bel-Kudluk, which was still further south, it
was impossible to say when he might overtake it.&nbsp; His
disappointment was great; but his cry was still
&ldquo;Onwards!&rdquo;&nbsp; By nine o&rsquo;clock next morning
the indefatigable traveller reached the foot of the grey, bare,
treeless heights of the Bukan-Tau.&nbsp; Though but a thousand
feet in elevation, they presented, with their glancing peaks,
their conical summits, their deep valleys, and awful precipices,
all the characteristics of an Alpine range of mountains.&nbsp;
Resting there for some hours, he took up, on the morrow, a line
of march around their northern slope, and gradually descended
into the plain.&nbsp; From some Kirghiz he ascertained that the
Grand-Duke Nicholas had joined General Kauffmann two days before,
and that the united Russian army had then marched for
Karak-Aty.&nbsp; The problem of overtaking it seemed more
incapable than ever of a satisfactory solution.&nbsp; But, on
studying his map, he found that from the point which he had
reached it was no further to Karak-Aty than to Tamdy, and he
instantly resolved to follow up a caravan route to the south,
which promised to lead to the former.</p>
<p>At noon he rode into the little valley of Yuz-Kudak, or the
&ldquo;Hundred Wells.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was completely bare of
vegetation, except a little thin grass, but was brightened by a
small, narrow runlet, which led, in less than a quarter of a
mile, to the water.&nbsp; There, along the valley, bubbled about
twenty-five or thirty wells or springs; in some the water
trickling over the surface, in others standing at a depth of from
five to ten feet.&nbsp; Thence, to the next well, was a distance
of twenty-five miles.&nbsp; The country was sandy, but <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>high and
broken up, with a low range of mountains on the left, extending
north-east and south-west.&nbsp; Next day Mr. MacGahan fell in
with a Kirghiz aul, where he was hospitably entertained by a
chief named Bii Tabuk.&nbsp; From him he learned that Kauffmann
had left Karak-Aty and arrived at Khala-Ata, one hundred miles
further to the south, and that the shortest way to Khala-Ata lay
right across the desert in the direction of the Oxus, a little
west of south.&nbsp; As there was no road, nor even a sheep path,
Mr. MacGahan sought for a guide, and eventually engaged a young
Kirghiz at the exorbitant fee of twenty-five roubles.&nbsp; Then,
having enjoyed a couple of days&rsquo; rest, he started before
sunrise on that interminable hunt after General Kauffmann, which
seemed to promise as romantic a legend as the voyage of Jason in
search of the Golden Fleece, or Sir Galahad&rsquo;s famous quest
of the Sangreal.</p>
<p>He had not ridden far, when, as the issue of a little intrigue
between his Tartar, his old guide, Mushuf, and his new guide, the
last named suddenly refused to proceed unless, in addition to the
twenty-five roubles, he received a horse or the money to buy
one.&nbsp; With prompt decision MacGahan dismissed the guide, and
when Ak-Mamatoff showed a disposition to be recalcitrant,
threatened him with his revolver.&nbsp; This display of firmness
and courage immediately produced a satisfactory effect.&nbsp;
Ak-Mamatoff humbled himself, and to prove the sincerity of his
penitence, rode to a neighbouring aul, and procured another and
more trustworthy guide.&nbsp; Afterwards they all breakfasted,
and once more rode across the sandy wastes in the direction of
Khala-Ata.&nbsp; Sand, sand, sand, <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>everywhere sand.&nbsp; The horses
struggled with difficulty through the huge drifts, and on the
second night one of them gave up, and had to be left
behind.&nbsp; Sand, sand, sand, everywhere sand; by day as by
night, and all so lonely and silent!&nbsp; For fifteen days
MacGahan had bravely plodded through the dreary, inhospitable
desert&mdash;when and how would his journey end?&nbsp; Still he
persevered: stumbling through the low coarse brushwood, sliding
down into deep sandy hollows; again, clambering painfully up
steep ascents, where the horses panted and laboured, and strove
with the heavy inexorable sand; over the hard-bound earth, where
their hoof&rsquo;s rang as on a stone pavement; late in the
night, he was glad to fling himself on the sand to snatch a brief
repose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have scarcely shut our eyes,&rdquo; says this
intrepid, indefatigable traveller, &ldquo;when we are called by
the guide to renew the march.&nbsp; It is still night, but the
desert is visible, dim and ghostly under the cold pale light of
the rising moon.&nbsp; Vegetation has entirely disappeared; there
is scarcely a twig even of the hardy saxaul.&nbsp; Side by side
with us move our own shadows, projected long and black over the
moonlit sand, like fearful spectres pursuing us to our doom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thin streaks of light begin to shoot up the eastern
sky.&nbsp; The moon grows pale, the shadows fade out, and at last
the sun, red and angry, rises above the horizon.&nbsp; After the
sharp cold of the night its rays strike us agreeably, suffusing a
pleasant sensation of warmth over our benumbed limbs.&nbsp; Then
it grows uncomfortably warm, then hot, and soon we <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>are again
suffering the pangs of heat and thirst; our eyes are again
blinded by the fiery glare, and our lungs scorched by the
stifling noonday atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout that day the ride was continued, and even far into
the night.&nbsp; Early next morning the traveller reached the
summit of the mountain range behind which lies Khala-Ata.&nbsp;
With feelings of eager expectancy and hope, he spurred forward
his horse, and with his field-glass looked down upon the bleak
bare plain which stretched far away in the direction of Bokhara;
there, at the distance of eight miles, he saw a dome-like mound,
encircled by small tents, which shone in the morning sunlight,
and at various points were grouped masses of soldiers in white
uniform, and the sheen of steel.&nbsp; At last, then, he had
overtaken Kauffmann!</p>
<p>Though weary and spent, and covered with the dust of the
desert, it was with a cheerful heart that, at about six
o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 16th of May, he rode into the
camp and fortress of Khala-Ata, after a ride of five hundred
miles and a chase of seventeen days.&nbsp; All the more bitter
was his disappointment when, on asking the young officer on duty
to direct him to the quarters of General Kauffmann, he was
informed that the general had left Khala-Ata, five days before,
and by that time must certainly have reached the Amu-Darya.&nbsp;
The chase, then, had been fruitless; the rider, daring and
indefatigable as he had showed himself, had missed his
mark.&nbsp; The commandant at Khala-Ata proved to be a Colonel
Weimam, who received the special correspondent with marked
discourtesy, <a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>and refused to allow him to continue his search for
General Kauffmann, unless he first obtained that general&rsquo;s
permission.&nbsp; The sole concession he would make was, that he
would send on Mr. MacGahan&rsquo;s letters of introduction, and
then, if the Russian commander-in-chief expressed a wish to see
him, he would be at liberty to go.&nbsp; This arrangement,
however, would evidently involve a delay of ten or twelve
days.&nbsp; In the mean time the army would cross the Oxus, would
capture Khiva, and the special correspondent&rsquo;s
&ldquo;occupation&rdquo; would be &ldquo;gone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Anxiously did Mr. MacGahan meditate on the course it would be
best for him to adopt.&nbsp; To break through the Russian lines
and effect his escape seemed impracticable.&nbsp; In all
probability, the swift-footed and ferocious Turcoman cavalry were
hanging in General Kauffmann&rsquo;s rear; and how, without an
escort, was he to make his way through their ranks?&nbsp; Yet the
more he reflected, the more he became convinced that this was his
only chance of reaching the Russian army in time to witness the
capture of Khiva.&nbsp; The difficulties in the way, apart from
the danger, were enormous.&nbsp; His horses were exhausted; he
had neither provisions nor forage, nor any means of procuring
them; and he might reckon on Colonel Weimam&rsquo;s despatching a
squadron of Cossacks to pursue and arrest him.&nbsp;
Ascertaining, however, that the colonel was about to move forward
with a couple of companies of infantry, one hundred Cossacks, and
two field-pieces, he resolved on the bold plan of quitting the
camp with the cavalry, trusting to the darkness to escape
detection, and afterwards making a wide circuit to pass the
detachment.&nbsp; Several days passed by in wretched <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>inaction.&nbsp; The heat was oppressive; clouds of dust
filled the atmosphere, and almost choked the unfortunate victims
exposed to its irritating influence; provisions were painfully
scarce, and Colonel Weimam absolutely refused to sell or give a
grain of barley to the traveller&rsquo;s starving horses.&nbsp;
At last, about one a.m. on the 14th of May, the Russian
detachment marched out of camp, and struck to the westward, in
the direction of Adam-Kurulgan and the Amu-Daria.&nbsp; Mr.
MacGahan and his men were on the alert.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dropped
silently,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;in the rear of the Cossacks, who
led the column, followed by my people, and when we had gained the
summit of the low sand-hill, a mile from the camp, over which the
road led, I as silently dropped out again, turned my
horses&rsquo; heads to the west, and plunged into the
darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he was in the open desert, once more he was free,
and he could not repress a feeling of exultation, though he was
suffering from hunger, his horses were spent with starvation, and
at any moment he might fall into the hands of the murderous
Turcomans.&nbsp; A more daring enterprise, or one conceived in a
more resolute and intrepid spirit, is hardly recorded, I think,
in the annals of adventure.&nbsp; When he supposed himself at a
sufficient distance from the Russian column, he turned sharp
round to the west, and made as straight as he could for the
Amu-Darya, expecting to reach it before Colonel Weimam.&nbsp; But
after a hard day&rsquo;s ride, he found, as he approached
Adam-Kurulgan, that the Russian soldiers were before him!&nbsp;
There seemed no alternative but to return to Khala-ata or
surrender himself to the obnoxious and despotic Weimam.&nbsp;
Yes; if he could get water for his exhausted beasts he <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>might avoid
Adam-Kurulgan altogether, and still pursue his wild ride to the
Oxus!&nbsp; Some Kirghiz guides, on their way to Khala-Ata,
informed him that twenty miles further on was Alty-Kuduk, or the
&ldquo;Six Wells;&rdquo; it was not on the road to the Amu, but
some four miles to the north, and Kauffmann had left some troops
there.&nbsp; This news revived his drooping spirits.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; he cried, and away through the deep
sand-drifts the little company toiled and struggled.&nbsp; He
lost another of his horses, and the survivors were almost mad
with thirst; but his cry was still &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He himself longed for water, with a longing unknown to those who
have not travelled in the arid desert and under the burning sun,
for hours and hours, without moistening the parched lips; but his
only thought was &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo;&nbsp; On the following
day the brave man&rsquo;s persistency was rewarded.&nbsp; He
reached the camp of Alty-Kuduk, met with a most friendly
reception from all its inmates, and obtained meat and drink for
himself and his men, and barley and water for his horses.</p>
<p>A day&rsquo;s rest, and he was again in the saddle (May
27th).&nbsp; It was soon apparent by the dead camels that lined
the road that he had got into the trail of the Russian army, and
from time to time he could recognize the tracks of cannon.&nbsp;
Then he came upon the bodies of Turcoman horses, which, as he
afterwards learned, had been slain in a skirmish two days
before.&nbsp; Towards sunset the character of the country
changed: the rolling sand dunes disappeared, and the traveller
entered upon a level plain, which sank away into a lower kind of
terrace.&nbsp; The day drew rapidly to a close: lower and lower
down the western sky <a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>sunk the blood-red sun; at last it
dropped below the horizon, and as the sky flashed momently with
broad streaks of red and purple and golden light, the shimmer of
water became visible in the distance.&nbsp; It was the Oxus!</p>
<p>It was long after dark when MacGahan reached the river.&nbsp;
He refreshed his horses with its waters, and then encamped for
the night.&nbsp; At daylight he ascended a hill, and looked out
upon the scene.&nbsp; The broad, calm river, winding north and
south, sparkled before him, like a belt of silver on a golden
mantle.&nbsp; But where was the Russian army?&nbsp; Where was
General Kauffmann?</p>
<p>Nowhere could he discover a trace of human habitation, of tent
or kibitka.&nbsp; Nowhere could he see a single picket, not even
a solitary Cossack.</p>
<p>Again was MacGahan disappointed.&nbsp; I have read of an old
superstition which represents a cup of gold as the prize of the
fortunate mortal who shall find the exact spot where a rainbow
touches the earth.&nbsp; And I have read that men, believing it,
have pursued the radiant iris with eager footsteps, only to find
her eluding them when most they think themselves sure of grasping
her.&nbsp; So was it with our special correspondent.&nbsp; He had
hoped to overtake the Russians at Myn-Bulak, but they had
vanished; at Khala-Ata, but he was too late; and again on the
Oxus, but they had disappeared.&nbsp; He was almost tempted to
look upon himself as the victim of a portentous delusion.&nbsp;
Would there really be a Kauffmann?&nbsp; Was the expedition to
Khiva other than a myth?</p>
<p>The tracks of cannon and the ashes of extinct campfires
reassured him on these points; and, <a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>rallying his energies, he set out
once more on his strange quest, following the course of the
Oxus.&nbsp; That day he rode five and forty miles.&nbsp; At night
he encamped, but as Khivans might be prowling in the vicinity, he
resolved to keep watch.&nbsp; For hours he paced up and down in
the darkness, a darkness that would have been death stillness but
for the murmur of the flowing river; and at length he caught a
flash of light.&nbsp; To him, like the light which Columbus saw
on the eve of the discovery of the New World, it portended the
end of his adventure; for it proceeded, as he knew, from either a
Khivan or a Russian bivouac.&nbsp; In the morning he started
early, and had ridden but a short distance, when loud upon his
ears broke the rolling thunder of artillery!&nbsp; Then he knew
that the army was close at hand, and engaged in desperate combat
with its Khivan enemies.</p>
<p>A few miles more, and Mr. MacGahan reached a sand-hill which
afforded him an extensive view of the valley of the river.&nbsp;
The opposite bank was crowded with horsemen, who were galloping
to and fro, while a couple of cannon placed in front of a small
pit were busily discharging missiles.&nbsp; On his own side the
Russians were posted in loose order, and looking quietly on;
their artillery replying to the Khivan fire with whizzing
shells.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a curious scene,&rdquo; says our
traveller; &ldquo;and I suppose the old Oxus, since the time it
first broke from the ice-bound springs of Pamir, had never heard
such music as this.&nbsp; Five times before had the Russians
attempted to reach this very spot, and five times had they
failed.&nbsp; Five times had they been driven back, beaten, and
demoralized, either by the difficulties of the way, the <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>inclemency
of the season, or the treachery of the Khivans.&nbsp; The one
detachment which had succeeded in capturing Khiva had afterwards
been slaughtered to the last man; and now the Russians stood at
last, this bright morning, on the banks of that historic river,
with their old enemy once more before them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Khivans soon retired, leaving the opposite bank entirely
free.&nbsp; Mr. MacGahan then started down the river to join the
Russian army, and in a short time found himself in their midst,
overwhelmed with friendly attentions.&nbsp; News of his gallant
ride across the Kyzil-Kum had preceded him, so that he was
received as a man who had quietly done a truly heroic
thing.&nbsp; His first duty was to pay his respects to the object
of his prolonged quest, General Kauffmann.&nbsp; The general,
wrapped up in a Bokharan khalat or gown, was seated in an open
tent, drinking tea and smoking a cigarette; a man of middle age,
bald, rather short of stature, beardless, but wearing a thick
moustache, prominent nose, blue eyes, and a pleasant kindly
countenance.&nbsp; He shook hands with MacGahan, asked him to sit
down, and remarked, with a smile, that he appeared to be
something of a &ldquo;molodyeltz&rdquo; (a brave fellow).&nbsp;
After questioning him respecting his adventures, he briefly told
the story of his campaign up to that time, and gave him full and
free permission to accompany the army the rest of the way to
Khiva.&nbsp; By the Grand-Duke Nicholas Mr. MacGahan was received
with equal courtesy.</p>
<p>The traveller now develops into the special correspondent, and
his record of travel changes into a chronicle of military
events.&nbsp; It would be inconsistent with our purpose to follow
minutely his narrative of <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>the Khivan war; but we shall
endeavour to select such passages as throw some light on the
nature of the country and the character of its inhabitants.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>The Khivans, according to Mr. MacGahan, are generally
medium-sized, lean, muscular fellows, with long black beards, and
no very agreeable physiognomy.&nbsp; They dress in a white cotton
shirt, and loose trousers of the same material, over which is
worn a khalat, or long tunic, cut straight, and reaching to the
heels.&nbsp; The Khivan khalat, with its narrow stripes of dirty
brown and yellow, differs very much indeed from the beautiful and
brilliant khalat of the Bokhariots.&nbsp; Most of the Khivans go
barefoot, and they cover their head with a tall, heavy, black
sheepskin cap, which is heavier, uglier, and more inconvenient
than even the bearskin of our household troops.&nbsp; In the
neighbourhood of Khiva they chiefly cultivate the soil, and their
prowess as horticulturists deserves to be renowned.&nbsp; For
miles around their capital the country blooms with well-kept
gardens, where fruit trees of all kinds flourish, and little
fields of waving corn.&nbsp; The houses and farmyards are
enclosed by stout walls, from fifteen to twenty feet high,
solidly buttressed, and flanked by corner towers.&nbsp; The
entrance is through an arched and covered gateway, closing with a
massive timber gate.&nbsp; The farmhouse, a rectangular building,
from twenty-five to seventy-five yards square, is built of dried
mud, worked into large blocks like granite, and measuring three
or four feet <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>square and as many thick.&nbsp; There is always a
little pond of clear water close at hand, and this is shaded by
three or four large elms, while the enclosures are planted with
elms and poplars.</p>
<p>Khiva surrendered to the Russians on the 9th.&nbsp; Mr.
MacGahan entered it in company with the victorious troops, but
confesses to experiencing a feeling of disappointment.&nbsp; The
grand or magnificent he had not expected; but his dreams of this
Oriental city, secluded far away in the heart of the desert, had
pictured it as impressive and picturesque, and they proved
entirely false.&nbsp; Through narrow, dirty, and crooked streets,
he advanced to the citadel.&nbsp; Entering by a heavy arched
brick gateway, he came in sight of a great porcelain tower,
shining brilliantly with green, and brown, and blue, and
purple.&nbsp; This tower, about one hundred and twenty-five feet
high, measured about thirty feet in diameter at the base, and
tapered gradually towards the top, where its diameter was about
fifteen feet.&nbsp; It was covered all over with burnt tiles,
arranged in a variety of broad stripes and figures, as well as
with numerous verses of the Koran.&nbsp; With the Khan&rsquo;s
palace, it forms one side of a great square, enclosed by the
walls of the citadel; the opposite side being occupied by a new
m&eacute;dress&eacute;, and the other two sides by sheds and
private houses.</p>
<p>In the palace nothing is worthy of notice except the
Khan&rsquo;s audience chamber, or great hall of state.&nbsp; Of
this you can form a good idea if you will tax your imagination to
conceive a kind of porch, opening on an inner court, measuring
about thirty feet high, twenty feet wide, and ten feet deep, and
flanked on either side by towers ornamented with blue and green
<a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>tiles.&nbsp; The floor was raised six feet, and the
roof supported by two curved, slender wooden pillars.&nbsp; The
other rooms were mostly dark and ill ventilated.&nbsp; At the
back of the hall of state was the Khan&rsquo;s treasury, a low
vaulted chamber, the walls and ceilings of which were covered
with frescoes of vines and flowers, executed on the most
fantastic principles of colouring.&nbsp; The gold, silver, and
precious stones had been removed, but not so the weapons, of
which there was a most various assortment: swords, guns, daggers,
pistols, revolvers, of almost every shape and description.&nbsp;
Two or three sabres were of English manufacture.&nbsp; There were
also many of the beautiful broad, slightly curved blades of
Khorassan, inlaid with gold; slender Persian scimitars, their
scabbards blazing with turquoises and emeralds; and short, thick,
curved poniards and knives from Afghanistan, all richly
enamelled, and their sheaths set in precious stones.&nbsp; In the
hurry of the Khan&rsquo;s departure, beautiful carpets had also
been left behind, silk coverlets, cushions, pillows, khalats, and
rich and rare Kashmir shawls.</p>
<p>In another apartment were found about three hundred volumes of
books, some old telescopes, bows and arrows, and several fine
suits of armour, which doubtlessly belonged to the era of the
Crusades, when the chivalry of Europe encountered the Saracens on
the plains of Syria and Palestine.</p>
<p>In the course of his wanderings Mr. MacGahan lighted upon the
Khan&rsquo;s harem, where his favourite Sultana and some other
women still remained.&nbsp; As he was an American&mdash;or,
rather, because they supposed him to be an Englishman&mdash;the
ladies gave him a <a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>cordial reception, and entertained him to tea.&nbsp;
They were eight in number: three were old and exceedingly ugly;
three middle-aged or young, and moderately good looking; one was
decidedly pretty; and the other whom Mr. MacGahan speaks of as
the Sultana, was specially distinguished by her superior
intelligence, her exquisite grace of movement, and her air of
distinction.&nbsp; She wore a short jacket of green silk,
embroidered with gold thread; a long chemise of red silk,
fastened on the throat with an emerald, slightly open at the
bosom, and reaching below the knees; wide trousers, fastened at
the ankles; and embroidered boots.&nbsp; She had no turban, and
her hair was curled around her well-shaped head in thick and
glossy braids.&nbsp; Curious earrings, composed of many little
pendants of pearls and turquoises, glanced from her ears, and
round her wrists gleamed bracelets of solid silver, traced with
gold.</p>
<p>The chamber in which these ladies sat was ten feet wide,
twenty long, and twelve high.&nbsp; Parts of the ceiling were
embellished with coloured designs, rude in conception and
execution.&nbsp; Against one side of the room were placed elegant
shelves, supporting a choice assortment of the finest Chinese
porcelain.&nbsp; The floor was strewn with carpets, cushions,
coverlets, shawls, robes, and khalats, all in admired disorder,
together with household utensils, arms, an English
double-barrelled hunting rifle, empty cartridges, percussion
caps, and&mdash;strange contrast!&mdash;two or three
guitars.&nbsp; It was evident that preparations for flight had
been begun, and the principal valuables already removed.</p>
<p>The Khan soon found that nothing was to be gained by flight,
and as the Russians were disposed <a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>to treat him leniently, he decided
on returning to Khiva, and surrendering to the great
Yarim-Padshah, the victorious Kauffmann.&nbsp; Mr. MacGahan, who
was present at the interview, describes the Asiatic potentate,
Muhamed Rahim Bogadur Khan, as at that time a man of about thirty
years of age, with a not unpleasing expression of countenance;
large fine eyes, slightly oblique, aquiline nose, heavy sensual
mouth, and thin black beard and moustache.&nbsp; He was about six
feet three inches high, with broad shoulders and a robust
figure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Humbly he sat before Kauffmann, scarcely
daring to look him in the face.&nbsp; Finding himself at the feet
of the Governor of Turkistan, his feelings must not have been of
the most reassuring nature.&nbsp; The two men formed a curious
contrast; Kauffmann was not more than half as large as the Khan,
and a smile, in which there was apparent a great deal of
satisfaction, played on his features, as he beheld Russia&rsquo;s
historic enemy at his feet.&nbsp; I thought there never was a
more striking example of the superiority of mind over brute
force, of modern over ancient modes of warfare, than was
presented in the two men.&nbsp; In the days of chivalry, this
Khan, with his giant form and stalwart arms, might have been
almost a demi-god; he could have put to flight a regiment
single-handed, he would probably have been a very C&oelig;ur de
Lion; and now the meanest soldier in Kauffmann&rsquo;s army was
more than a match for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The capital of this Asiatic potentate is, as I have hinted,
deficient in remarkable characteristics.&nbsp; With three or four
exceptions, the buildings are all of clay, and present a
miserable appearance.&nbsp; There <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>are two walls&mdash;an outer and an
inner; the interior enclosing the citadel, which measures a mile
in length by a quarter of a mile in breadth, and in its turn
encloses the Khan&rsquo;s palace and the great porcelain
tower.&nbsp; The outer wall is on an average twenty-five feet
high, and it is strengthened by a broad ditch or moat.&nbsp;
There are seven gates.&nbsp; The area between the walls is at one
point converted into a kind of cemetery; at another it is planted
out in gardens, which are shaded by elms and fruit trees, and
watered by little canals.&nbsp; Of the houses it is to be said
that the interior is far more comfortable than the wretched
exterior would lead the traveller to anticipate.&nbsp; Most of
them are constructed on the same plan.&nbsp; You pass from the
street into a large open court, all around which are arranged the
different apartments, each opening into the court, and seldom
having any direct communication with each other.&nbsp; Facing the
north stands a high porch, with its roof some seven or eight feet
above the surrounding walls; this serves to catch the wind, and
bring it down into the court below on the principle of a
wind-sail aboard ship.&nbsp; The free circulation of air thus
maintained is, undoubtedly, very pleasant in the summer heat, but
in a Khivan winter it must have its disadvantages.</p>
<p>With twenty-two m&eacute;dress&eacute;s, or monasteries, and
seventeen mosques, is Khiva endowed.&nbsp; Of the latter, the
most beautiful and the most highly esteemed is the mosque
Palvan-Ata, which raises its tall dome to a height of sixty feet,
shining with tiles of glaring green.&nbsp; The interior of the
dome is very striking: it is covered, like the exterior, with
tiles, but these <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>are adorned with a beautiful blue tracery, interwoven
with verses from the Koran.&nbsp; In a niche in the wall,
protected by a copper lattice-work, are the tombs of the Khans;
and Palvan, the patron-saint of the Khivans, is also buried
there.</p>
<p>From the mosques we pass to the baz&aacute;r, which is simply
a street covered in, like the arcades so popular in some English
towns.&nbsp; The roof consists of beams laid from wall to wall
across the narrow thoroughfare, supporting planks laid close
together, and covered with earth.&nbsp; On entering, you are
greeted by a pleasant compound scent of spices, by all kinds of
agreeable odours, and by the confused sounds of men and
animals.&nbsp; As soon as your eyes grow accustomed to the shade,
they rest with delight on the rich ripe fruit spread everywhere
around you in tempting masses.&nbsp; Khiva would seem to be the
paradise of fruit epicures.&nbsp; There are apricots, and grapes,
and plums, and peaches, and melons of the finest quality and
indescribable lusciousness.&nbsp; But if you want more solid
fare, you can enjoy a pilaoff with hot wheaten cakes, and wash
down the repast with stimulating green tea.&nbsp; After which,
refreshed and thankful, you may sally forth to make your
purchases of boots or tobacco or khalats, cotton stuffs or silk
stuffs, calico from Manchester, muslin from Glasgow, robes from
Bokhara, or Russian sugar.&nbsp; This done, you are at leisure to
survey for a while the motley crowd that surges to and fro.&nbsp;
The Uzbeg, with his high black sheepskin hat and long khalat,
tall, well-formed, swarthy, with straight nose and regular
features; the Kirghiz, in coarse dirty-brown khalat, with broad,
flat, stolid countenance; the Bokhariot merchant, <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>with turban
of white and robe of many colours; the Persian, with quick,
ferret-like eyes, and nimble, cat-like motions; and the Yomud
Turcoman, with almost black complexion, heavy brows, fierce black
eyes, short upturned nose, and thick lips.&nbsp; These pass
before you like figures in a phantasmagoria.</p>
<p>Weary with the noise and shifting sights, you gladly accept an
invitation to dine with a wealthy Uzbeg, and accompany him to his
residence.&nbsp; The day is very warm; in a cloudless sky reigns
supreme the sun; and you rejoice when you find that your host has
ordered the banquet to be spread in the pleasant garden, amid the
shade of green elms and the sparkle of running waters.&nbsp; Your
first duty is to remove your heavy riding-boots, and put on the
slippers which an attendant hands to you; your second is to make
a Russian cigarette, and drink a glass of nalivka, or Russian
gooseberry wine, as a preparation for the serious work that
awaits you.&nbsp; Then a cloth is spread, and the dinner
served.&nbsp; Fruits, of course&mdash;apricots, melons, and the
most delicious white mulberries; next, three or four kinds of
dainty sweetmeats, which seem to consist of the kernels of
different nuts embedded in a kind of many-coloured toffee.&nbsp;
Into a frothy compound, not unlike ice-cream with the ice left
out, you dip your thin wheaten cakes, instead of spoons.&nbsp;
Various kinds of nuts, and another glass of nalivka, precede the
principal dish, which is an appetizing pilaoff, made of large
quantities of rice and succulent pieces of mutton, roasted
together.</p>
<p>The dinner at an end, large pipes are brought in.&nbsp; Each
consists of a gourd, about a foot high, filled <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>with water;
on the top, communicating with the water through a tube, rests a
bowl, containing the fire and tobacco.&nbsp; Near the top, on
either side, and just above the water, is a hole; but there is no
stem.&nbsp; The mode of using it is this: you take up the whole
vessel in your hand, and then blow through one of the holes to
expel the smoke.&nbsp; Next, stopping up one hole with your
finger, you put your mouth to the other, and inhale the smoke
into your lungs.&nbsp; You will probably be satisfied with three
or four whiffs on this gigantic scale.</p>
<p>Mr. MacGahan had an opportunity of seeing the interior of an
Uzbeg house, and he thus describes it:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is little attempt at luxury or taste in the house
of even the richest; and in this respect the poorest seems almost
on an equality with the most opulent.&nbsp; A few carpets on the
floor; a few rugs and cushions round the wall, with shelves for
earthenware and China porcelain; three or four heavy, gloomy
books, bound in leather or parchment; and some pots of jam and
preserved fruit, generally make up the contents of the
room.&nbsp; There are usually two or three apartments in the
house different from the others, in having arrangements for
obtaining plenty of light.&nbsp; In these rooms you find the
upper half of one of the walls completely wanting, with the
overhanging branches of an elm projecting through the
opening.&nbsp; The effect is peculiar and striking, as well as
pleasant.&nbsp; From the midst of this room&mdash;with mud walls
and uneven floor, with the humblest household utensils, and
perhaps a smoking fire&mdash;you get glimpses of the blue sky
through the green <a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>leaves of the elm tree.&nbsp; A slightly projecting
roof protects the room from rain; in cold weather, of course, it
is abandoned.&nbsp; Two or three other rooms are devoted to the
silkworms, the feeding and care of which form the special
occupation of the women.&nbsp; The worms naturally receive a
great deal of attention, for their cocoons pay a great part of
the household expenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But let us suppose that an Uzbeg host closes up the
entertainment he has provided for us with a dance.</p>
<p>The dancers are two young boys&mdash;one about eight, the
other about ten years of age&mdash;with bare feet, a little
conical skull-cap on their shaven heads, and a long loose khalat
drooping to their ankles.&nbsp; The orchestra is represented by a
ragged-looking musician, who sings a monotonous tune to the
accompaniment of a three-stringed guitar.&nbsp; The boys begin to
dance; at first with slow and leisurely movements, swaying their
bodies gracefully, and clapping their hands over their heads to
keep time to the music.&nbsp; But as this grows livelier, the
boys gradually become more excited; striking their hands wildly,
uttering short occasional shouts, turning somersaults, wrestling
with each other, and rolling upon the ground.</p>
<p>Towards nightfall, torches will be brought on the scene; some
being thrust into the ground, and others fastened to the trunks
and branches of trees.&nbsp; The comelier of the juvenile dancers
now attired himself as a girl, with tinkling bells to his wrists
and feet, and a prettily elaborate cap, also decked with bells,
as well as with silver ornaments, and a long pendent veil
behind.&nbsp; He proceeds to execute a quiet and <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>restrained
dance by himself, lasting, perchance, for about a quarter of an
hour; and the other boy coming forward, the two dance together,
and enact a love-scene in a really eloquent pantomime.&nbsp; The
girl pretends to be angered, turns her back, and makes a pretence
of jealousy, while the lover dances lightly around her, and
endeavours to restore her to amiability by caresses and all kinds
of devices.&nbsp; When all his efforts fail, he sulks in his
turn, and shows himself offended.&nbsp; Thereupon the lady begins
to relent, and to practise every conciliatory art.&nbsp; After a
brief affectation of persistent ill humour, the lover yields, and
both accomplish a merry and animated measure with every sign of
happiness.</p>
<p>When the Russians left Khiva in the month of August, Mr.
MacGahan&rsquo;s mission was ended.&nbsp; He had been present
with them at the fall of Khiva, and in the campaign which they
afterwards undertook&mdash;it would seem, with little or no
justification&mdash;against the Yomud Turcomans.&nbsp; On the
return march he accompanied the detachment in charge of the sick
and wounded, descending the Oxus to its mouth, and then
proceeding up the Aral Sea to the mouth of the Syr-Daria.&nbsp;
The voyage on the Aral occupied two days and a night.&nbsp;
Having entered the Syr-Daria, thirty-six hours&rsquo; sailing
brought the flotilla to Kasala&mdash;the point from which, as we
have seen, Mr. MacGahan had started, some months before, on his
daring ride through the desert.&nbsp; After a sojourn of three
days, he started in a tarantass for Orenburg.</p>
<p>It will be owned, I think, that Mr. MacGahan&rsquo;s
enterprise was boldly conceived and boldly executed; that he
displayed, not only a firm and manly courage, <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>but a
persistent resolution which may almost be called heroic.&nbsp; He
showed himself possessed, however, of even higher qualities; of a
keen insight into character, a quick faculty of observation, and
a humane and generous spirit.</p>

293</span>COLONEL EGERTON WARBURTON,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND EXPLORATION IN WEST
AUSTRALIA.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> north-west of the
&ldquo;island-continent&rdquo; of Australia seems to have been
discovered almost simultaneously by the Dutch and Spaniards about
1606.&nbsp; Twenty years later, its west coast was sighted; and
in 1622 the long line of shore to the south-west.&nbsp; Tasmania,
or, as it was first called, Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land, was visited
by the Dutch navigator Tasman in 1642.&nbsp; Half a century
passed, and Swan River was discovered by Vlaming.&nbsp; The real
work of exploration did not begin, however, until 1770, when
Captain Cook patiently surveyed the east coast, to which he gave
the name of New South Wales.&nbsp; In 1798, in a small boat about
eight feet long, Mr. Bass, a surgeon in the navy, discovered the
strait that separates Tasmania from Australia, and now
perpetuates his memory.&nbsp; He and Lieutenant Flinders
afterwards circumnavigated Tasmania; and Flinders, in 1802 and
1803, closely examined the south coast, substituting, as a
general designation of this &ldquo;fifth quarter of the
world,&rdquo; Australia for the old boastful Dutch name of New
Holland.&nbsp; <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>He also explored the great basin of Port Philip, and
discovered the noble inlets of St. Vincent and Spencer
Gulfs.&nbsp; In 1788 the British Government selected Botany Bay,
on the east coast, as a place of transportation for criminals;
and from this inauspicious beginning sprang the great system of
colonization, which, developed by large and continual emigration
from the mother country, has covered Australia with flourishing
States.&nbsp; Tasmania became a separate colony in 1825; West
Australia, originally called Swan River, in 1829; South Australia
in 1834; Victoria in 1851; Queensland in 1859.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
the exploration of the interior was undertaken by a succession of
bold and adventurous spirits, starting at first from New South
Wales.&nbsp; The barrier of the Blue Mountains was broken
through, and rivers Macquarie, Darling, and Lachlan were in time
discovered.&nbsp; In 1823 Mr. Oxley surveyed the Moreton Bay
district, now Queensland, and traced the course of the
Brisbane.&nbsp; In 1830 Captain Sturt explored the Murray, the
principal Australian river, to its confluence with Lake
Victoria.&nbsp; In 1840 Mr. Eyre, starting from Adelaide,
succeeded, after enduring severe privations, in making his way
overland to King George&rsquo;s Sound.&nbsp; In the following
year he plunged into the interior, which he believed to be
occupied by a great central sea; he found only the swamp and
saline bays of Lake Torrens.&nbsp; Captain Sturt, in 1845,
penetrated almost to the southern tropic in longitude 130&deg;
E., traversing a barren region as waterless and as inhospitable
as the Sahara.&nbsp; About the same time Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt,
with some companions, successfully passed from Moreton Bay to <a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>Port
Errington; but, in 1848, attempting to cross from east to west,
from New South Wales to the Swan River, he and his party
perished, either from want of provisions or in a skirmish with
the natives.&nbsp; In the same year Mr. Kennedy, who had
undertaken to survey the north-east extremity of Australia, was
murdered by the natives.&nbsp; Thus Australian exploration has
had its martyrs, like African.&nbsp; In 1860 Mr. M&rsquo;Douall
Stuart crossed the continent from ocean to ocean, or, more
strictly speaking, from South Australia to a point in lat.
18&deg; 40&prime; S., about two hundred and fifty miles from the
coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria.&nbsp; The hostility of the
natives prevented him from actually reaching the coast.&nbsp; In
August, 1860, a similar expedition was projected by some
gentlemen belonging to the colony of Victoria; and, under the
command of Robert O&rsquo;Hara Burke, it started from Melbourne
for Cooper&rsquo;s Creek, whence it was to proceed to the
northern coast.&nbsp; Some of the members, namely, Burke, Mr.
Wills, the scientific assistant, and King and Gray, two
subordinates, succeeded in reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria; but
on their return route they suffered from want of provisions, and
all perished except King.&nbsp; In 1862 Mr. M&rsquo;Douall Stuart
renewed his bold project of crossing the continent, and starting
from Adelaide, arrived in Van Diemen&rsquo;s Bay, on the shore of
the Indian Ocean, July 25th.&nbsp; Numerous other names might be
added to this list; but we shall here concern ourselves only with
that of Colonel Egerton Warburton, as one of the most eminent and
successful of Australian explorers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Peter Egerton Warburton was born in August, 1813.&nbsp; <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>After
passing through the usual examination in the East India
Company&rsquo;s college at Addiscombe, he entered the Bombay army
in 1834, and served in India until 1853, passing the greater part
of the time in the Adjutant-General&rsquo;s Department, and
rising through each grade until he attained his majority, and was
appointed Deputy Adjutant-General at head-quarters.&nbsp; But,
attracted by the prospects opened up to colonists in New Zealand,
he resigned the service, intending to proceed thither with his
wife and family.&nbsp; Eventually, circumstances led to his
preferring South Australia as a field for his energies; and soon
after his arrival at Adelaide he was selected to command the
police force of the whole colony&mdash;an onerous post, which he
held with distinction for thirteen years.&nbsp; He was afterwards
made commandant of the volunteer forces of the colony of South
Australia.&nbsp; In August, 1872, the South Australian Government
resolved on despatching an expedition to explore the interior
between Central Mount Stuart and the town of Perth, in West
Australia, and chose Colonel Warburton as its leader.&nbsp;
Afterwards, the Government drew back, and the cost of the
expedition was eventually undertaken by two leading colonists,
Messrs. Elder and Hughes, who authorized Colonel Warburton to
organize such a party and prepare such an outfit as he considered
necessary, and provided him with camels and horses.&nbsp; It was
arranged that the party should muster at Beltana Station, the
head-quarters of the camels; thence proceed to the Peake, lat.
28&deg; S., one of the head-quarters of the inland telegraph;
and, after a d&eacute;tour westward, make for Central Mount
Stuart, where they would receive a reinforcement of camels, and,
<a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>thus
strengthened, would be able to cross the country unknown to
Perth, the capital of Western Australia.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>With his son Richard as second in command, Colonel Warburton
left Adelaide on the 21st of September, 1872; reached Beltana
Station on the 26th; and on the 21st of December arrived at Alice
Springs (1120 miles from Adelaide), the starting-point of his
journey westward.&nbsp; The party consisted of himself, his son,
T. W. Lewis, two Afghan camel-drivers, Sahleh and Halleem, Denis
White (cook and assistant camel-man), and Charley, a native
lad.&nbsp; There were four riding and twelve baggage camels,
besides one spare camel; the horses being left at Alice
Springs.&nbsp; All needful preparations having been completed,
the explorers quitted the station on the 15th of April, 1873, and
turned their faces westward.</p>
<p>For the first five days not a drop of water was seen, and on
the fifth, of the supply carried with them only one quart was
left, which it was necessary to reserve for emergencies.&nbsp;
When they encamped for the night, no fire was lighted, as without
water they could not cook.&nbsp; Next day, the 20th, Lewis and
the two Afghans were sent, with four camels, to refill the casks
and water-bags at Hamilton Springs, about twenty-five miles
distant.&nbsp; Meanwhile, a shower of rain descended; all the
tarpaulins were quickly spread, and two or three buckets of water
collected.&nbsp; What a change!&nbsp; All was now activity,
cheerfulness, heartfelt thanksgiving.&nbsp; A cake and a pot of
tea were soon in everybody&rsquo;s hands, and in due time Lewis
returned with a full supply of water, to increase and partake in
the general satisfaction.</p>
<p><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>Keeping still in a general westerly direction, they
crossed extensive grassy plains, relieved occasionally by
&ldquo;scrub&rdquo; or bushes, and coming here and there upon a
spring or well.&nbsp; &ldquo;The country to-day,&rdquo; writes
Warburton, on one occasion, &ldquo;has been beautiful, with
parklike scenery and splendid grass.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
&ldquo;creeks,&rdquo; as the water-courses are termed in
Australia, they sometimes found a little water; more often, they
were quite dry.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is certainly,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;a beautiful creek to look at.&nbsp; It must at times carry
down an immense body of water, but there is none now on its
surface, nor did its bed show spots favourable for retaining
pools when the floods subsided.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the 9th of
January they struck some glens of a picturesque character.&nbsp;
At the entrance of the first a huge column of basalt had been
hurled from a height of three hundred feet, and having fixed
itself perpendicularly in the ground, stood like a sentry,
keeping guard over a fair bright pool, which occupied the whole
width of the glen&rsquo;s mouth&mdash;a pool about fifteen feet
wide, fifty feet long, and enclosed by lofty and precipitous
basaltic cliffs.&nbsp; At the entrance, the view does not extend
beyond thirty yards; but, on accomplishing that distance, you
find that the glen strikes off at a right angle, and embosoms
another pool of deep clear water, circular in shape, and so
roofed over by a single huge slab of basalt that the sun&rsquo;s
rays can never reach it.&nbsp; There is a second glen, less
grand, less rugged than the former, but more picturesque.&nbsp;
At the head of it bubble and sparkle many springs and much
running water.</p>
<p>The surrounding country was clothed with porcupine-grass
(spinifex)&mdash;a sharp thorny kind of <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>herbage,
growing in tussocks of from eighteen inches to five feet in
diameter.&nbsp; When quite young, its shoots are green; but as
they mature they assume a yellow colour, and instead of
brightening, deepen the desolate aspect of the wilderness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is quite uneatable even for camels, who are compelled
to thread their way painfully through its mazes, never planting a
foot on the stools, if they can possibly avoid it.&nbsp; To
horses on more than one occasion it has proved most destructive,
piercing and cutting their legs, which in a very short time
become fly-blown, when the animals have either to be destroyed or
abandoned.&nbsp; The spiny shoots are of all heights, from the
little spike that wounds the fetlock to the longer blade that
penetrates the hock.&nbsp; It is one of the most cheerless
objects that an explorer can meet, and it is perhaps unnecessary
to say that the country it loves to dwell in is utterly useless
for pastoral purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coming to a range of granite, steep, bare, and smooth, Colonel
Warburton clambered up its face on hands and knees, to find there
a fine hole or basin in the rock, perfectly round and nearly full
of water.&nbsp; This hole was, of course, the work of nature,
and, strange to say, was on the point of a smooth projecting part
of the rock, where it would have seemed impossible that any water
could lodge.&nbsp; How it was wrought in such a place one cannot
imagine, but the position was so prominent as to be visible from
the plain at a considerable distance.</p>
<p>Another day the travellers fell in with a bees&rsquo;
hive;&mdash;unfortunately, it was empty.&nbsp; The Australian bee
is stingless, and very little larger than our common house-fly,
but its honey is remarkably sweet.&nbsp; The <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>nest, or
&ldquo;sugar-bag,&rdquo; as the bushmen call it, is generally
made in a hollow tree.&nbsp; They also saw some specimens of the
crested dove&mdash;one of the loveliest of the Australian
pigeons.&nbsp; In truth, it is hardly surpassed anywhere in
chasteness of colouring and elegance of form, while its graceful
crest greatly enhances the charm of its appearance.&nbsp; It
frequently assembles in very large flocks, which, on visiting the
lagoons or river banks for water, during the dry seasons,
generally congregate on a single tree or even branch, perching
side by side, and afterwards descending in a body to drink; so
closely are they massed together while thus engaged, that dozens
may be killed by a single discharge of a gun.&nbsp; Their flight
is singularly swift; with a few quick flaps of the wings they
gain the necessary impetus, and then sail forward without any
apparent exertion.</p>
<p>The diamond-sparrow, or spotted pardalote, was also
seen.&nbsp; This bird inhabits the whole of the southern parts of
the Australian continent, from the western to the eastern border,
and is very common in Tasmania.&nbsp; It is nearly always engaged
in searching for insects among the foliage both of the tallest
trees and the lowest shrubs, in the garden and orchard as in the
open forest; and it displays in all its movements a remarkable
activity, clinging about in every variety of position, both above
and beneath the leaves, with equal facility.&nbsp; Its mode of
nest-building differs from that of every other member of the
genus to which it belongs.&nbsp; It first excavates, in some
neighbouring bank, a hole just large enough to admit of the
passage of its body, in a nearly horizontal direction, to the
depth of two or three feet; at the end of this <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>burrow or
gallery, it forms a chamber; and in this chamber it deposits its
nest, which is beautifully woven of strips of the inner bark of
the Eucalypti, and lined with finer strips of the same or similar
materials.&nbsp; In shape it is spherical, about four inches in
diameter, with a lateral hole for an entrance.&nbsp; To prevent
the ingress of rain the chamber is raised somewhat higher than
the mouth of the hole.&nbsp; Mr. Gould, the Australian
naturalist, speaks of these nests as very difficult to detect;
they can be found, he says, only by watching for the ingress or
egress of the parent birds, as the entrance is generally
concealed by herbage or the overhanging roots of a tree.&nbsp;
Why so neat a structure as the diamond-sparrow&rsquo;s nest
should be constructed at the end of a gallery or tunnel, into
which no light can possibly enter, is beyond comprehension; it is
one of those wonderful results of instinct so often brought
before us in the economy of the animal kingdom, without our being
able to explain them.&nbsp; The diamond-sparrow rears two broods,
of four or five each, in the course of the year.&nbsp; Its song
or call is a rather harsh, piping note of two syllables,
frequently repeated.</p>
<p>The great difficulty which besets the Australian explorer is
the want of water.&nbsp; He travels day after day across open
grassy plains, relieved by few variations of surface, except the
sand ridges, to meet with neither spring nor watercourse.&nbsp;
Sometimes he comes upon the native wells, but these, very
frequently, are dry or almost dry; he digs well after well
himself, but no water rises.&nbsp; Colonel Warburton&rsquo;s
party suffered severely from this deficiency.&nbsp; They met with
much trouble, moreover, through the straying of their <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>camels.&nbsp; Thus, one evening, &ldquo;Charley,&rdquo;
who acted as camel-herd, reported that they had run away
southward.&nbsp; He traced their tracks for several miles, and
observed that one camel had broken its hobbles. <a
name="citation302"></a><a href="#footnote302"
class="citation">[302]</a>&nbsp; Halleem, the Afghan
camel-driver, then mounted the Colonel&rsquo;s riding camel,
&ldquo;Hosee,&rdquo; and started in search of them at five
o&rsquo;clock on a Sunday evening.&nbsp; He was to push on for
five or six miles, then camp for the night, and at dawn follow up
the tracks vigorously, so as to overtake the truants, and return
by mid-day.</p>
<p>Monday came, but Halleem and the camels came not with
it.&nbsp; Sahleh, who had been exploring in the vicinity of the
camp with a gun, returned in the evening with the startling
information that he had seen Hosee&rsquo;s <i>return</i> track,
coming near the camp, and then striking off in a north-easterly
direction.&nbsp; Colonel Warburton now also learned for the first
time that Halleem was occasionally subject to fits, and that
while they lasted he knew not what he was doing or where he was
going.&nbsp; It was evident that such a man ought not to have
been trusted alone, and it became a question whether Halleem had
lost his camel or his wits; the latter seemed more probable, as
Hosee, if he had come near the other camels, would certainly have
joined them.</p>
<p>Next day, Monday, July 22nd, the Colonel
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;I sent my son and Charley with a
week&rsquo;s provisions on our back tracks, to try for Halleem
first; but, in the event of not finding his <i>foot</i> tracks,
to continue on, and endeavour to recover the camels.&nbsp; Lewis
also <a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>went in the other direction, to run up Hosee&rsquo;s
tracks; so that I hoped that by one or other of these means I
should learn what had become of Halleem.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
Lewis, supposing he had only a few hours&rsquo; work, took
neither food nor water.&nbsp; Now, 6 p.m., it is beginning to
rain, and Lewis has not returned.&nbsp; I know he will stick to
the tracks as long as he can, but I wish he were back; if Halleem
be demented, he may urge the camel on sixty or seventy miles
without stopping, and thus get a start in his mad career that
will make it impossible for Lewis to help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;23rd.&nbsp; It has rained lightly all night.&nbsp;
Lewis is still absent; I am greatly grieved at his having nothing
to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1 p.m.&nbsp; Lewis returned; he had camped with
Richard, and so was all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears from his report that Sahleh, whilst out
&lsquo;birding,&rsquo; must have stumbled upon a mare&rsquo;s
nest, for Lewis soon abandoned the track he started on, and
turned after Richard to find Halleem&rsquo;s first camp.&nbsp;
They did not find this, but they fell on his tracks of next day,
steadily following the runaway camels; it is clear, therefore,
that Sahleh has done his countryman some injustice, and caused
much unnecessary alarm. . . . Richard returned, having seen
Halleem, and promised to take out provisions to meet him on his
return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;26th.&nbsp; Sahleh shot an emu (<i>Dromaius Novoe
Hollandic&aelig;</i>), a welcome addition to our larder.&nbsp;
Every scrap of this bird was eaten up, except the feathers.&nbsp;
The liver is a great delicacy, and the flesh by no means
unpalatable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;27th and 28th.&nbsp; Sent provisions to Ethel Creek for
Halleem.</p>
<p><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>&ldquo;29th.&nbsp; The camel-hunters returned in the
evening, but without the camels.&nbsp; This is a double loss; the
camels are gone, and so is our time; our means of locomotion are
much reduced, whilst the necessity of getting on is greatly
increased.&nbsp; Halleem has, however, done all he could do; he
followed the camels nearly one hundred miles, but as they
travelled night and day, whilst he could only track them by day,
he never could have overtaken them.&nbsp; No doubt these animals
will go back to Beltana, where alarm will be created as soon as
they are recognized as belonging to our party.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Such is the Colonel&rsquo;s simple, unaffected account of what
was really an annoying and perplexing incident.</p>
<p>At this date (July 29th) the explorers had accomplished
seventeen hundred miles.&nbsp; The country continued to present
the same general features&mdash;plains yellow with
porcupine-grass, alternating with low hills of sand; but as they
advanced, the sand-hills became more numerous, and among them lay
numerous half-dry salt lagoons of a particularly cheerless
aspect.&nbsp; Dense spinifex&mdash;high, steep sand-ridges, with
timber in the flats, and nothing for the camels to eat but low
scrubby bushes;&mdash;that horses should cross such a region is
obviously impossible.&nbsp; The want of water again became
urgent.&nbsp; From the burnt ground clouds of dust and sand were
thrown up by the wind, almost choking the travellers, and
intensifying their thirst.&nbsp; They were temporarily relieved
by coming upon a native well.&nbsp; But the country still wore
the same cheerless aspect of inhospitality; the desolate arid
plain extended in every region&mdash;a desert of sand, <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>which
wearied the travellers by its monotony.&nbsp; Even when they
arrived at the so-called basaltic hills, there was no water, no
sign of green and pleasant vegetation.&nbsp; It was quite an
excitement when, for the first time, they descried some
flock-pigeons.&nbsp; The birds were very wild, and they could
kill only three or four, but they were excellent eating, and made
quite a dainty dish.&nbsp; Soon after this cheerful episode,
Lewis, who had been sent on a short excursion south in quest of
water, returned with intelligence of an Eden oasis which he had
discovered in the wilderness.&nbsp; A beautiful clump of large
gum trees flourished at the bottom of a small creek, which was
hemmed in by a high sand-hill, and afterwards broke through a
rocky ridge sprinkled with fine, clear, deep water-holes, one
hundred feet in circumference.&nbsp; The rich green foliage of
the gum trees contrasted vividly with the red sand-hills on
either side, and the bare rocky barrier in front.&nbsp; To this
delightful spot of greenery, bustard, bronze-wing pigeons, owls,
and other birds resorted.</p>
<p>Colonel Warburton, however, was averse to retrace his steps,
even to enjoy a halt in such an &ldquo;earthly paradise;&rdquo;
and, pushing forward, was rewarded for his persistency by
discovering a fine large lake of fresh water, haunted by ducks,
flock-pigeons, and parrots.&nbsp; He halted on its borders for a
couple of days.</p>
<p>Of the bronze-wing pigeon, to which allusion has just been
made, it may be affirmed that it prevails in every part of
Australia.&nbsp; In some individuals the forehead is brown, in
others buff white; the crown of the head and occiput, dark brown,
shading into plum colour; sides of the neck, grey; upper surface
of <a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>the
body, brown, each feather edged with tawny brown; wings, brown,
with an oblong spot of lustrous bronze on the coverts; the tail
feathers, deep grey, with a black band near the tip, except the
two central, which are brown; under surface of the wing,
ferruginous; breast, deep wine-colour, passing into grey on the
under parts; bill, blackish grey; legs and feet, carmine
red.&nbsp; It is a plump, heavy bird, and, when in good
condition, weighs nearly a pound.&nbsp; Its favourite haunts are
the dry hot plains, among the bushes or
&ldquo;scrub.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its speed is very surprising; in an
incredibly short time it traverses a great expanse of
country.&nbsp; Before sunrise it may be seen in full flight
across the plain, directing its course towards the creeks, where
it quenches its thirst.&nbsp; The traveller who knows its habits
can, by observing it, determine, even in the most arid places,
whether water is near at hand; if he descry it wending its way
from all quarters towards a given point, he may rest assured that
there he will obtain the welcome draught he seeks.&nbsp; Mr.
Gould says that it feeds entirely upon the ground, where it finds
the varieties of leguminous seeds that constitute its food.&nbsp;
It breeds during August and the four following months, that is,
in the Australian spring and summer, and often rears two or more
broods.&nbsp; Its nest is a frail structure of small twigs,
rather hollow in form; and is generally placed on the horizontal
branch of an apple or gum tree, near the ground.&nbsp; On one
occasion, Mr. Gould, during a long drought, was encamped at the
northern extremity of the Brezi range, where he had daily
opportunities of observing the arrival of the bronze-wing to
drink.&nbsp; The only water <a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>for miles around lay in the vicinity
of his tent, though that was merely the scanty supply left in a
few small rocky basins by the rains of many months before.&nbsp;
Hence, he enjoyed an excellent opportunity for observing not only
the bronze-wing, but all the other birds of the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Few, if any, of the true insectivorous or
fissirostral birds came to the water-holes; but, on the other
hand, the species that live upon grain and seeds, particularly
the parrots and honey-eaters (<i>Trichoglossi</i> and
<i>Meliphagi</i>), rushed down incessantly to the margins of the
pools, heedless of the naturalist&rsquo;s presence, their sense
of peril vanquished temporarily by their sense of thirst.&nbsp;
The bronze-wing, however, seldom appeared during the heat of the
day; it was at sunset that, with the swiftness of an arrow, it
rushed towards the watering-place.&nbsp; It did not descend at
once, says Mr. Gould, to the brink of the pool, but dashed down
upon the ground at about ten yards&rsquo; distance, remained
quiet for a while until satisfied of its safety, and then
leisurely walked to the water.&nbsp; After deep and frequent
draughts, it retired, winging its way towards its secluded
nest.</p>
<p>Just before reaching the lake, the Colonel&rsquo;s party made
a capture, a young native woman; and they detained her in order
that she might guide them to the native wells.&nbsp; On the 1st
of September, however, she effected her escape by gnawing through
a thick hair-rope, with which she had been fastened to a
tree.</p>
<p>Spinifex and sand resumed their predominance as the travellers
left the lake behind them.&nbsp; The heat was very great, and
crossing the hot sand and the steep hills was trying work.&nbsp;
On the 12th, they <a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>rejoiced in the discovery of some excellent
wells.&nbsp; Then again came spinifex and sand-hills.&nbsp; These
troublesome ridges varied considerably in height and in distance
from one another; but their elevation seldom exceeded eighty
feet, and the space between them was not often more than three
hundred yards.&nbsp; They lay parallel to one another, running
from east to west; so that while going either eastward or
westward the travellers could keep in the intervening hollows,
and travel with comparative facility, but when compelled to cross
them at a great angle, the feet of the camels ploughed deep in
the sand, and the strain upon the poor animals was
terrible.&nbsp; Yet the Australian waste is, after all, less
wearisome than the sandy deserts of Nubia or the great Sahara; it
is sadly deficient in water, but the sand-hills disguise their
inhospitality with many varieties of shrubs and flowers, as well
as with acacias and gum trees.&nbsp; The shrubs are not edible,
and the trees are of no value as timber, but they serve to hide
the nakedness of the land.</p>
<p>A grave danger beset them on the 15th.&nbsp; Their master bull
(or male) camel had eaten poison, and fell ill; he was of immense
value to the travellers, not only on account of his great
strength, but because without his help it would be almost
impossible to keep the young bulls in order, and they might elope
with all the ewe (or female) camels.&nbsp; They administered to
him a bottle of mustard in a quart of water&mdash;the only
available medicine&mdash;but without any beneficial effect.&nbsp;
In every herd of camels, it is necessary to explain, is found a
master bull, who, by his strength, preserves order among his
young brethren.&nbsp; These <a name="page309"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>gay cavaliers are always desirous of
a harem to themselves; and, if allowed an opportunity, would cut
off three or four cows from the herd, and at full speed drive
them for hundreds of miles.&nbsp; They are quiet only while under
subjection to the master bull, and become intractable if, through
illness or accident, his supremacy should be relaxed.&nbsp;
Colonel Warburton was surprised at the marvellous instinct of the
young bulls in his little camel harem; they knew that their
master was ailing almost before the camel-men did, and at once
showed signs of insubordination, so that it was necessary to
watch them by night and to knee-halter them.</p>
<p>The old camel did not improve, and on the 16th the Colonel was
compelled to abandon him.&nbsp; Three misfortunes followed: on
the 17th two riding camels were taken ill, having been struck in
the loins by the night wind; and on the 18th the same fate befell
Richard Warburton&rsquo;s riding camel.&nbsp; Thus, in three days
the travellers lost four camels.&nbsp; They endeavoured to make
some profit out of the misadventure by &ldquo;curing&rdquo; a
quantity of camel-meat.&nbsp; The inner portions of the animal
were first eaten&mdash;not the liver and other dainty parts only,
but the whole; every single scrap was carefully consumed, not a
shred was wasted.&nbsp; Then, head, feet, hide, tail, all went
into the boiling pot.&nbsp; Even the very bones were stewed down,
for soup first, and afterwards for the sake of the marrow they
contained.&nbsp; The flesh was cut into thin flat strips, and
hung upon the bushes for three days to be dried by the sun.&nbsp;
The tough thick hide was cut up and parboiled, the coarse hair
scraped off with a knife, and the leathery substance replaced in
the pot and <a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>stewed until, both as to flavour and savour, it bore a
disagreeable resemblance to the inside of a carpenter&rsquo;s
glue-pot.&nbsp; As may be supposed, such a dish as this was not
so nutritious as the roast beef (or mutton) of Old England; but
it stifled for a while the cry of an empty stomach.&nbsp; The
attack next fell upon the head, which was speedily reduced to a
polished skull.&nbsp; As for the foot, like cow-heel or
sheep&rsquo;s trotters, it was looked upon as a delicacy, and its
preparation was a marvel of culinary skill.&nbsp; First, a good
fire was lighted, and allowed to burn down to bright red embers,
while the foot, severed at the hock, was scraped and singed as
thoroughly as time permitted.&nbsp; The foot was thrust into the
glowing coals, burnt for some considerable time, removed, placed
on its side on the ground, and deprived of its tough horny
sole.&nbsp; After this elaborate series of operations, the reader
will doubtless suppose that the delicacy is fit for the
table.&nbsp; Not a bit of it!&nbsp; It must be placed in a bucket
of water, and kept steadily boiling for six and thirty hours;
then, and then only, may it be served up.&nbsp; On the whole, we
should not consider it a dish for a hungry man.</p>
<p>The 21st of September was the anniversary of their departure
from Adelaide.&nbsp; Two of the party went out on camels to
search for water, and two, in a different direction, on
foot.&nbsp; As they had only two riding camels left, and these in
a weak condition, they threw away their tents, and most of their
private property, retaining only their guns and ammunition, and
clothing enough for decency.&nbsp; Happily, one of the
reconnoitring parties found a well, to which the travellers at
once proceeded, and watered the thirsty, weary camels.</p>
<p><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>After
a three days&rsquo; halt they resumed their advance, but moved
very slowly.&nbsp; They were sick and feeble, and the country was
difficult to traverse.&nbsp; Another camel had to be abandoned;
so that out of seventeen animals, only eight remained.&nbsp; A
plague of insects was added to their troubles.&nbsp; Not only did
clouds of common flies buzz and worry around them, and legions of
ants assail them, but the Australian bee, or honey-fly, tormented
them by its pertinacious adhesion to their persons&mdash;an
unwelcome adhesion, as it is famed for its intolerable
smell.&nbsp; To get water they were again compelled to wander
from the direct route, and at one time they descended as far
south as lat. 20&deg; 2&prime;.&nbsp; Hence they began to suffer
from want of provisions, and a grim alternative faced them: if
they pressed forward, they ran the chance of losing their camels
and dying of thirst; if they halted, they could hope only to
prolong their lives on sun-dried camel flesh.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of October their condition was critical.&nbsp; The
improvident Afghans, having consumed all their flour and meat,
had to be supplied from the scanty rations of the white men, and
Colonel Warburton resolved that if water were but once more
found, so that he might not be compelled to retrace his steps, he
would at all risks push forward to the river Oakover.&nbsp;
Another riding camel broke down, and was killed for meat.&nbsp; A
well was discovered, but the supply of water was so small that
only one bucketful could be obtained in three hours, and on the
second day it ran dry.&nbsp; On the 8th, having slightly
recruited their animals, the undaunted travellers again moved
forward; but one of the camels was still so feeble that <a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>Colonel
Warburton and his son took it in turns to walk.&nbsp; The Colonel
had the first stage, and, owing to stoppages from loads slipping
off at the sand-hills, he soon struck ahead of the camels.&nbsp;
Suddenly, hearing a noise behind him, he turned;&mdash;nine armed
blacks were rushing full upon him!&nbsp; He halted to confront
them, and they too stopped, at fifteen yards apart; two of them,
in bravado, poised their spears, but, on his advancing pistol in
hand, immediately lowered them, and a parley followed, in which,
however, as neither understood the other&rsquo;s language, there
was very little edification.</p>
<p>The blacks were all chattering round him, when he heard a
shot, as he supposed, on his &ldquo;right front.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
reality it was fired from quite an opposite direction; but he was
unwilling to answer the signal, because he did not wish to lose
one of the three charges of his pistol.&nbsp; Moreover, the
natives might have supposed that the single discharge had
exhausted his resources, and have made an attack upon him.&nbsp;
He accompanied them to their camp, and got a little water.&nbsp;
The women and children would not approach him, but, thanks to his
grey beard, the men similarly equipped welcomed him
readily.&nbsp; There was a general passing of hands over each
other&rsquo;s beards&mdash;a sign of friendship, it is to be
presumed; for, after this little ceremony, the intercourse was
conducted on the most amicable terms.&nbsp; Eventually the
Colonel resumed his walk across the hot glaring sand-hills, until
he thought he had covered the required distance, and that the
camels would soon overtake him; then he stopped, lighted a fire,
smoked a pipe, and would have indulged in a short nap, had the
ants been agreeable.&nbsp; Finding that <a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>sleep was
impossible, he resolved on returning to the camp of the blacks
for some more water; but, at that moment, his son and Lewis
arrived with Charley, who had followed up his tracks, and he
found that he must retrace his steps, having gone astray.&nbsp;
Exhausted by heat, hunger, and fatigue, he could scarcely stagger
along; but his companions supported his tottering feet, and in
the evening he reached their encampment.</p>
<p>A good supply of water had been discovered, and,
notwithstanding the alarming scarcity of provisions, it was
indispensable that they should halt by it for some days, in order
to give the camels an opportunity of partially recovering their
strength.&nbsp; Without them the explorers could hardly hope to
cross the wide and weary wilderness in which they were
involved.&nbsp; Their rapidly diminishing store of food they
endeavoured to eke out by killing such feathered spoil as came
within their range&mdash;Gular parrots, and bronze-wing and
top-knot pigeons&mdash;and by a mess of boiled salt-plant
(<i>Salicornia</i>).&nbsp; On the 14th they resumed their weary
march.</p>
<p>An entry or two from Colonel Warburton&rsquo;s journal will
afford a vivid idea of his distressed condition at this
period:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;19th.&nbsp; This is Sunday.&nbsp; How unlike one at
home!&nbsp; Half a quart of flour and water at four a.m.; a hard,
sinewy bit of raw, that is, sun-dried, but uncooked, camel-meat
for dinner at two p.m.; supper uncertain, perhaps some roasted
acacia seeds: this is our bill of fare.&nbsp; These seeds are not
bad, but very small and very hard; they are on bushes, not trees,
and the natives use them roasted and pounded.</p>
<p><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>&ldquo;20th.&nbsp; Got a pigeon; and some flour and
water for breakfast.&nbsp; We can only allow ourselves a spoonful
of flour each at a time, and it won&rsquo;t last many days even
at this rate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed a large camel for food at sunset.&nbsp; We would
rather have killed a worse one, but this bull had, in the early
part of our journey, got a very bad back, and was unable to work
for a long time. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;21st.&nbsp; Cutting up and jerking camel-meat.&nbsp;
The inside has given us a good supper and breakfast.&nbsp; This
is a much better beast than the old, worn-out cow we killed
before, and we have utilized every scrap, having had a sharp
lesson as to the value of anything we can masticate. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;25th.&nbsp; All the camel-meat has been successfully
jerked, and we have lived since the 20th on bone-broth and
gristle.&nbsp; The birds were getting shy, so when we killed the
camel we gave them a rest; to-day we go at them again.&nbsp; I
hope the water-searchers will return this evening; our prospects
are not very bright under any circumstances, but if we get water
anywhere between south and west we shall have a prospect of
overcoming the difficulties and dangers that threaten us. . .
.</p>
<p>&ldquo;29th.&nbsp; A short rain squall passed over us last
evening; it has cooled the ground a little.&nbsp; Economy is, of
course, the order of the day in provisions.&nbsp; My son and I
have managed to hoard up about one pound of flour and a pinch of
tea; all our sugar is gone.&nbsp; Now and then we afford
ourselves a couple of spoonfuls of flour, made into paste.&nbsp;
When we indulge in tea the leaves are boiled twice over.&nbsp; I
eat my sun-dried camel-meat uncooked, as far as I can bite it;
what I <a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>cannot bite goes into the quart pot, and is boiled down
to a sort of poor-house broth.&nbsp; When we get a bird we dare
not clean it, lest we should lose anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More disasters this morning.&nbsp; One of our largest
camels very ill; the only thing we could do for it was to pound
four boxes of Holloway&rsquo;s pills, and drench the animal. . .
.&nbsp; One of the Afghans apparently wrong in his head. . .
.&nbsp; In the evening the camel was still very sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The animal, however, was better on the following day, and the
expedition again toiled onward across the sands.&nbsp; Very
troublesome were the ants, which seemed to have undertaken a
deliberate campaign against the much-suffering travellers.&nbsp;
They were small black ants, and in such numbers that a stamp of
the foot on the ground started them in thousands.&nbsp; When the
wearied men flung themselves down in the shade of a bush to
obtain the solace of half an hour&rsquo;s sleep, these pestilent
persecutors attacked them, making their way through their scanty
clothing, and dealing sharp painful nips with their strong
mandibles.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 1st of November, they began their
&ldquo;rush&rdquo; or forced march for the Oakover river, and
across the wearisome sand-hills actually accomplished five and
twenty miles.&nbsp; Colonel Warburton then felt unable to
continue the journey, thirst, famine, and fatigue having reduced
him to a skeleton, while such was his weakness that he could
scarcely rise from the ground, or when up, stagger half a dozen
steps forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Charley&rdquo; had been absent all
day, and when he did not return at sunset, much <a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>alarm was
felt about him.&nbsp; The Colonel knew not what to do.&nbsp;
Delay meant ruin to them all, considering their want of food and
water; yet to leave the camp without the Colonel seemed inhuman,
as it was dooming him to certain death.&nbsp; Until nine
o&rsquo;clock in the evening they waited.&nbsp; Then a start was
made, but before they had gone eight miles, the poor lad joined
them.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the fatigue of the previous
night&rsquo;s travelling, the lad had actually walked about
twenty miles; he had fallen in with a large party of natives, and
accompanied them to their water.&nbsp; &ldquo;It may, I think, be
admitted,&rdquo; says Colonel Warburton, &ldquo;that the hand of
Providence was distinctly visible in this
instance.&rdquo;&mdash;Is it not in <i>every</i>
instance?&mdash;&ldquo;I had deferred starting until nine p.m.,
to give the absent boy the chance of regaining the camp.&nbsp; It
turned out afterwards that if we had expedited our departure by
ten minutes, or postponed it for the same length of time, Charley
would have crossed us; and had this happened, there is little
doubt that not only myself, but probably other members of the
expedition, would have perished from thirst.&nbsp; The route
pursued by us was at right angles with the course pursued by the
boy, and the chances of our stumbling up against each other in
the dark were infinitesimally small.&nbsp; Providence mercifully
ordered it otherwise, and our departure was so timed that, after
travelling from two to two hours and a half, when all hope of the
recovery of the wanderer was almost abandoned, I was gladdened by
the &lsquo;cooee&rsquo; of the brave lad, whose keen ears had
caught the sound of the bells attached to the camels&rsquo;
necks.&nbsp; To the energy and courage of this untutored native
may, under the guidance of the Almighty, <a
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>be
attributed the salvation of the party.&nbsp; It was by no
accident that he encountered the friendly well.&nbsp; For
fourteen miles he followed up the tracks of some blacks, though
fatigued by a day of severe work, and, receiving a kindly welcome
from the natives, he had hurried back, unmindful of his own
exhausted condition, to apprise his companions of the important
discovery he had made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the native camp, Colonel Warburton&rsquo;s party obtained
some kangaroo meat, and a good supply of fresh water.&nbsp; They
rested for twenty-four hours, and the repose and the food
together temporarily reinvigorated them.&nbsp; At this time their
position was lat. 20&deg; 41&prime;, and long. 122&deg;
30&prime;; so that they were only three days&rsquo; journey from
the Oakover.&nbsp; Forward they went, the country still
presenting the two main features of sand and spinifex; forward
they went, over the cheerless, monotonous plains, broken by sand
ridges; growing weaker every day, but losing not one jot of hope
or resolution.&nbsp; The annals of travel present few examples of
more heroic tenacity and persistent purpose; few records of
suffering more patiently borne, or of obstacles more steadfastly
overcome.&nbsp; The highest energy, perseverance, and fortitude
were necessary to the leader of an exploring expedition through
so forlorn a wilderness, and these were never wanting on the part
of Colonel Warburton, whose name, amongst the pioneers of
civilization in Australia, must always be held in honour.</p>
<p>On the 11th of November, the seven members of the expedition
were living wholly on sun-dried strips of meat, as devoid of
nutriment as they were of taste; and as these were almost
exhausted, they <a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>had to consider the probability of having to sacrifice
another camel.&nbsp; They had no salt&mdash;a terrible
deprivation; no flour, tea, or sugar.&nbsp; Next day, they were
surrounded by sand-hills, and no water was visible
anywhere.&nbsp; It was certain that, unless some providentially
opportune help arrived, they could not live more than twenty-four
hours; for the burning heat and the terrible country could not be
endured without water.&nbsp; Not a snake, kite, or crow could
they discover; one little bird, the size of a sparrow, was all
that their guns could procure.&nbsp; Writing in his journal, the
Colonel calmly says:&mdash;&ldquo;We have tried to do our duty,
and have been disappointed in all our expectations.&nbsp; I have
been in excellent health during the whole journey, and am so
still, being merely worn out from want of food and water.&nbsp;
Let no self-reproaches afflict any one respecting me.&nbsp; I
undertook the journey for the benefit of my family, and was quite
equal to it under all the circumstances that could reasonably be
anticipated, but difficulties and losses have come upon us so
thickly for the last few months that we have not been able to
move; thus our provisions are gone, but this would not have
stopped us could we have found water without such laborious
search.&nbsp; The country is terrible.&nbsp; I do not believe men
ever traversed so vast an extent of continuous desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early on the 14th Charley sighted in the distance a native
camp, and while the remainder of the party, with the camels, kept
out of sight, he advanced alone towards it.&nbsp; The blacks
received him kindly and gave him water, but when he
&ldquo;cooed&rdquo; for the party to come up, they seem to have
thought he had entrapped <a name="page319"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 319</span>them, and instantly speared him in
the back and arm, cut his skull with a tomahawk, and nearly broke
his jaw.&nbsp; After perpetrating this cruelty, they fled
ignominiously.&nbsp; Colonel Warburton took possession of the
fire they had kindled, and rejoiced at obtaining water.&nbsp;
Charley&rsquo;s wounds were serious, but they were bound up as
carefully as circumstances permitted, and it is satisfactory to
state that he recovered from them.&nbsp; Another camel was
killed, and Charley was nursed upon soup.&nbsp; This supply of
meat enabled the expedition to continue its march towards the
Oakover, which receded apparently as they advanced; and they
toiled onward painfully, with the hot sun and hot wind exhausting
their small resource of energy, the ants tormenting them at
night, the sand and spinifex oppressing them by their
monotony.&nbsp; On the 25th, to save themselves from starvation,
they killed another camel, and all hands were employed in cutting
up and jerking the meat.&nbsp; At last, on the 4th of December,
they camped on a rocky creek, tributary to the Oakover, and were
able to take leave of the dreadful desert which had so long
hemmed them in on every side.&nbsp; Their spirits revived, for
there was no longer a scarcity of water and they hoped that the
river would supply them with the means of subsistence.</p>
<p>But they had soon reason to feel that their difficulties were
not all at an end.&nbsp; It was pleasant to look on the beautiful
trees and profuse vegetation of the creek, but the charms of
nature will not satisfy stomachs that have had no food for two
days.&nbsp; So, on the evening of the 6th, a third camel was
killed.&nbsp; Next day a few small fish were caught; they were
greatly relished, and proved of real benefit.&nbsp; The 8th <a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>was happily
marked by another banquet of fish; but as they had no net or
fishing apparatus, it was by no means easy work to catch
them.&nbsp; Still, the travellers did not grow stronger; want of
rest and of wholesome food, and the strain of continuous exertion
and anxiety for so long a period, had undermined the whole
system, and they could not rally.</p>
<p>On the 11th they struck the Oakover in lat. 21&deg; 11&prime;
23&Prime;.&nbsp; This must be a noble river, writes the Colonel,
when the floods come down.&nbsp; The bed is wide and gravelly,
fringed with magnificent cajeput or paper-bark trees.&nbsp; How
grateful was its lovely and shady refuge from the hot fierce sun
after the terrible sand-hills among which the travellers had
wandered so long!</p>
<p>On the 13th Lewis and an Afghan driver, on the only two camels
that could travel, were sent forward to search for the station of
Messrs. Harper and Co., and procure some help both in food and
carriage.&nbsp; During his absence the Colonel and his companions
lived, to use an expressive phrase, from hand to mouth.&nbsp;
They could not get the fish to bite; but one day Richard
Warburton shot a teal, and they rescued from the talons of a hawk
a fine black duck, which supplied them with a splendid
dinner.&nbsp; They were compelled, however, to fall back upon
their last camel, though he was so lean and worn-out that he did
not cut up well.&nbsp; On the 23rd they rejoiced in the capture
of a couple of wood-ducks, and they also secured a little
honey&mdash;a delightful novelty for persons who for many weeks
had been deprived of the strengthening and useful properties of
sugar.&nbsp; Still, these occasional &ldquo;tidbits&rdquo; could
not supply the <a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>want of regular and nutritious food; and all the
travellers could hope for was to stave off actual famine.&nbsp;
Day after day passed by, and Lewis did not return.&nbsp; Colonel
Warburton had calculated that he would be absent about fourteen
days; but the seventeenth came, and yet there was no sign of
Lewis.&nbsp; Writing in his journal, Colonel Warburton, on
December 20th, sums up his position in a few pithy and pregnant
sentences:&mdash;&ldquo;We have abundance of water, a little
tobacco, and a few bits of dried camel.&nbsp; Occasionally an
iguana or a cockatoo enlivens our fare; and, lastly, I hope the
late rain will bring up some thistles or some pig-weed that we
can eat.&nbsp; Our difficulties are, to make our meat last,
though, so far from doing us good, we are all afflicted with
scurvy, diarrhoea, and affection of the kidneys from the use of
it.&nbsp; We cannot catch the fish; we cannot find opossums or
snakes; the birds won&rsquo;t sit down by us, and we can&rsquo;t
get up to go to them.&nbsp; We thought we should have no
difficulty in feeding ourselves on the river, but it turns out
that, from one cause or another, we can get very little, and we
are daily dropping down a peg or two lower.&rdquo;&nbsp; But a
few hours after making this entry, the Colonel&rsquo;s long
period of suffering and anxiety was at an end.&nbsp; He and his
son were lying down near the little hut of boughs which they had
constructed as a shelter, and listlessly eyeing the boy Charley,
who had climbed a tree to look for honey, when they were startled
by his cry&mdash;whether a yell of pain or shout of joy, it was
impossible to determine.&nbsp; But in a moment the cause of his
emotion was satisfactorily explained; out from the thick
brushwood trotted a string of six horses, driven by the gallant
<a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>Mr.
Lewis, accompanied by another white man from a station on the De
Grey river.&nbsp; They brought an ample supply of nutritious
food, and on the following day some additional stores came up on
camels.&nbsp; Mr. Lewis&rsquo;s apparent delay was soon
explained; the station, which belonged to Messrs. Grant, Harper,
and Anderson, was one hundred and seventy miles distant.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of January Colonel Warburton started down the
river.&nbsp; For the first few days he had to be lifted on his
horse&rsquo;s back, but with good food and moderate exercise he
regained something of his old strength, and the journey to the
station was accomplished in a week and a day.&nbsp; Ten days were
then given to rest under the hospitable roof of Messrs. Grant,
and on the 21st he started for Roebourne, one hundred and seventy
miles further, arriving there on the 26th.&nbsp; His after stages
were Lepack, Fremantle, Perth, Albany.&nbsp; At Glenelg, in South
Australia, the Colonel and his companions arrived on Easter
Sunday, having travelled by land four thousand miles, and by sea
two thousand miles.</p>
<p>The casualties are quickly recorded: the Colonel lost the
sight of one eye, and his son&rsquo;s health was seriously
shaken.&nbsp; Out of seventeen camels, only two arrived safely at
the station on the De Grey river.</p>
<p>It is almost needless to say that everywhere in West Australia
Colonel Warburton was received with the public honours due to a
man who has courageously and successfully accomplished a work of
equal difficulty and danger.&nbsp; He was entertained in the most
generous and cordial manner, and the high utility of his labours
was liberally acknowledged.&nbsp; On his <a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>return to
South Australia he met, of course, with an enthusiastic
welcome.&nbsp; A great banquet was given to the explorers, and
the Legislative Assembly voted the sum of &pound;1000 to the
leader, and &pound;500 to be divided among the
subordinates.&nbsp; In 1874 the Royal Geographical Society of
London conferred upon him its gold medal, and a few months later
the Queen appointed him a Companion of the Order of St. Michael
and St. George.</p>
<p>Here closes a simple but stirring narrative, of which it is
not, perhaps, too much to say, as has been said, that scarcely
has a record of terrible suffering more nobly borne been given to
the world.&nbsp; Hunger and thirst, intense physical exhaustion,
the burning heat of a tropic sun, the glowing sands of an arid
desert&mdash;not a single circumstance was wanting that could
test the heroic endurance and patient heroism of the
explorers.&nbsp; The country through which they toiled day after
day was barren, inhospitable, desolate; a wilderness of coarse
yellow herbage, a sombre waste of sand-hills.&nbsp; Their hearts
were never cheered by bright glimpses of gorgeous scenery, of
forests clothed with magnificent vegetation, of rivers pouring
their ample waters through sylvan valleys; everywhere the
landscape was melancholy and unprofitable.&nbsp; He who, with his
life in his hand, penetrates the frozen recesses of the Polar
World, and dares its storms of snow and its icy winds, has at
least the inspiration to support him that springs from the
grandeur of huge cliffs of ice and vast glaciers and
white-gleaming peaks outlined against a deep blue sky.&nbsp; But
in the wide Australian interior the landscape is always marked by
the same monotony of <a name="page324"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 324</span>dreariness, the same uniformity of
gloom; and it tests and taxes the traveller&rsquo;s energies to
rise superior to its depressing influences.</p>
<p>The reader, therefore, will feel that &ldquo;the Municipal
Council and inhabitants of Fremantle&rdquo; used no language of
undeserved eulogy when, in their address of welcome to Colonel
Egerton Warburton, they said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difficulties to be overcome in the work of
Australian exploration are acknowledged to be as formidable as
are to be found in any part of our globe, and to meet these
difficulties requires a combination of intelligence, energy,
perseverance, and fortitude that few men possess; and the fact
that you have surmounted all obstacles, and borne up under so
many privations, has awakened in all our minds the deepest
feelings of gratitude and admiration.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a

325</span>MAJOR BURNABY,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND A RIDE TO KHIVA.</span></h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> vast and various region of
sandy deserts and fertile valleys, of broad open plains and lofty
highlands, which extends eastward from the Caspian Sea to the
borders of Afghanistan, and from Persia northward to the confines
of Siberia, is known to geographers by the name of Turkistan, or
&ldquo;the country of the Turks.&rdquo;&nbsp; Across it, from
north to south, strikes the massive chain of the Bolor-tagh,
dividing it into two unequal portions.&nbsp; The western division
is popularly known as Independent Tartary, or Great Bokhara; it
covers an area of nearly 900,000 square miles&mdash;that is, it
is ten times as large as Great Britain&mdash;and it consists of
the arid sandy plain of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and of the
hilly districts which skirt the ranges of the Bolor-Tagh, the
Thian-Shan, and the Hindu Kush.&nbsp; The eastern division, or
Upper Tartary, probably contains 700,000 square miles, and
extends from Asiatic Russia on the north to Thibet and Kashmir on
the south, from Mongolia on the east to the Bolor-Tagh on the
west.&nbsp; The Thian-Shan separates its two provinces, which the
Chinese call Thian-Shan-Pe-l&ucirc; and
Thian-Shan-Nan-l&ucirc;.&nbsp; The reader&rsquo;s attention, <a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>however,
will be here directed only to Western Turkistan, which is divided
into the Khanates of Khokan (north-east), Badakshan (south-east),
Bokhara (east), and Khiva (west).&nbsp; To the north stretch the
steppes of the nomadic Kirghiz; to the south the hills and dales
are occupied by the hordes of the Turkomans.&nbsp; Its two great
rivers are the Amu-Daria and the Syr-Daria, the ancient
<i>Oxus</i> and <i>Jaxartes</i>,&mdash;the former traversing the
centre, and the latter the south of the district, on their way to
the great Arabian Sea; and the valleys through which they flow,
as well as those of their tributary streams, are mostly fertile
and pleasant.&nbsp; As might be inferred from the character of
the country, the chief resources of the population are the
breeding of domestic animals, and the cultivation of the soil;
but in the towns of Khokand, Bokhara, Urgondji, and Karshi, a
brisk manufacturing industry flourishes, which disposes of its
surplus produce, after the local demand is satisfied, to the
merchants of Russia, Persia, India, and China.</p>
<p>Since 1864, the supremacy of Russia has been steadily
advancing in Western Turkistan.&nbsp; In ordinary circumstances,
the extension of the power of a civilized nation over a number of
semi-barbarous states, constantly engaged in internecine warfare,
is regarded as a just and legitimate movement, or, at all events,
as one that is inevitable and calls for no expression of regret;
but the eastward progress of Russia has long been considered, by
a large party in England, as a menace to the safety of our Indian
empire.&nbsp; Every fresh step of the Russian armies has
therefore excited alarm or created suspicion among those who are
known as Russophobists.&nbsp; How far <a name="page327"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 327</span>their fear or their mistrust is
justifiable or dignified it is not our business in these pages to
inquire; but it has been necessary to allude to it because it was
this Russophobism which impelled Major (then Captain) Burnaby to
undertake the difficult, if not dangerous, task of visiting
Western Turkistan, that he might see with his own eyes what the
Russians were doing there.&nbsp; The Russians had recently
conquered Khokand and Khiva; it was thought they were preparing
for further annexations; and Major Burnaby determined on an
effort to reach Khiva, which during the Russian campaign had been
visited, as we have seen, by Mr. MacGahan, the war correspondent
of the <i>New York Herald</i>.&nbsp; Having obtained leave of
absence from his regiment, the Royal Horse Guards, Major Burnaby
rapidly equipped himself for his adventurous journey.&nbsp; He
was well aware that the Russian authorities did not welcome the
inquisitive eyes of English travellers, and that from them he
could expect no assistance.&nbsp; His confidence in his
resources, however, was great; he felt <i>totus in se ipso</i>;
and he did not intend to be baffled in his object by anything but
sheer force.&nbsp; The climate was another difficulty.&nbsp; The
cold of the Kirghiz desert is a thing unknown in any other part
of the world, even in the Arctic wastes and wildernesses; and he
would have to traverse on horseback an enormous expanse of flat
country, extending for hundreds of miles, and devoid of
everything save snow and salt-lakes, and here and there the
species of bramble-tree called saxaul.&nbsp; The inhabitants of
Western Europe can form no conception of the force of the winds
in Turkistan.&nbsp; They grumble at the pungent, irritating east;
but they little imagine what it is like in countries exposed to
<a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>the
awful vehemence of its first onset, before its rigour has been
mitigated by the kindly ocean, and where its wild career is
unimpeded by trees or rising land, by hills or mountains.&nbsp;
Uninterruptedly it blows over dreary leagues of snow and salt,
absorbing the saline matter, and blighting or almost gashing the
faces of those unfortunates who are exposed to its fury.&nbsp;
But no fear of the east wind prevailed over Major Burnaby&rsquo;s
patriotic curiosity.&nbsp; He provided against it as best he
could: warm were the garments specially made for him; his boots
were lined with fur; his hose were the thickest Scottish fishing
stockings; his jerseys and flannel shirts of the thickest
possible texture; and he ordered for himself a waterproof and
airproof sleeping-bag, seven feet and a half long, and two feet
round.&nbsp; A large aperture was left on one side, so that the
traveller might take up his quarters in the interior, and sleep
well protected from the wintry blasts.&nbsp; For defensive
purposes he took with him his rifle, a revolver, cartridges, and
ball.&nbsp; His cooking apparatus consisted of a couple of
soldier&rsquo;s mess-tins.&nbsp; A trooper&rsquo;s hold-all, with
its accompanying knife, fork, and spoon, completed his kit; and,
by way of instruments, he carried a thermometer, a barometer, and
a pocket sextant.</p>
<p>On the 30th of November, 1875, Major Burnaby left
London.&nbsp; He arrived at St. Petersburg on the 3rd of
December, and immediately set to work to obtain the necessary
authorization for his proposed journey, which he defined as a
tour to India <i>vi&acirc;</i> Khiva, Merv, and Kabul; in other
words, across Central Asia and Afghanistan.&nbsp; All that he
<i>did</i> obtain was a communication to the effect that the
commandants in <a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
329</span>Russian Asia had received orders to assist him in
travelling through the territory under their command, but that
the Imperial Government could not acquiesce in his extending his
journey beyond its boundaries, as it could not answer for the
security or the lives of travellers except within the
Emperor&rsquo;s dominions&mdash;a self-evident fact.&nbsp; The
reply was evidently intended to discourage Major Burnaby; but
Major Burnaby was not to be discouraged.&nbsp; It is not in the
English character to be daunted by a consideration of prospective
or possible dangers; certainly, it is not in the character of
English officers.&nbsp; So the adventurous guardsman started by
railway for Orenburg, the great centre and dep&ocirc;t of Central
Asiatic traffic.&nbsp; At Riajsk he obtained a vivid illustration
of the heterogeneous character of the Russian empire, the
waiting-room being crowded with representatives of different
nationalities.&nbsp; Here stalked a Tartar merchant in a long
parti-coloured gown, a pair of high boots, and a small yellow
fez.&nbsp; There a fur trader, in a greasy-looking black coat,
clutched his small leather bag of coin.&nbsp; Here an old
Bokharan, in flowing robes, was lulled by opium into a temporary
forgetfulness of his troubles.&nbsp; There Russian peasants moved
to and fro, with well-knit frames, clad in untanned leather,
which was bound about their loins by narrow leather belts,
studded with buttons of brass and silver.&nbsp; Europe and Asia
met together in the waiting-room at Riajsk station.</p>
<p>The railway went no further than Sizeran, where Major Burnaby
and a Russian gentleman hired a troika, or three-horse sleigh, to
take them to Samara.&nbsp; The distance was about eighty-five
miles; but as <a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>the thermometer marked 20&deg; below zero (R.), the
travellers found it necessary to make formidable
preparations.&nbsp; First they donned three pairs of the thickest
stockings, drawn up high above the knee; next, over these, a pair
of fur-lined low shoes, which in their turn were inserted into
leather goloshes; and, finally, over all, a pair of enormously
thick boots.&nbsp; Allow for extra thick drawers and a pair of
massive trousers; and add a heavy flannel under-shirt, a shirt
covered by a thick wadded waistcoat and coat, and an external
wrap in the form of a large shuba, or fur pelisse, reaching to
the heels; and you may suppose that the protection against the
cold was tolerably complete.&nbsp; The head was guarded with a
fur cap and vashlik, <i>i.e.</i> a kind of conical cloth
headpiece made to cover the cap, and having two long ends tied
round the throat.&nbsp; Thus accoutred, the travellers took their
places in the troika, which, drawn by three horses harnessed
abreast, and with jingling bell, rapidly descended the hill, and
dashed on to the frozen surface of the river Volga.&nbsp; Along
the solid highway furnished by the ice-bound stream, past
frozen-in shipping and sledges loaded with various kinds of
wares, sped the troika; sometimes, in its turn, outstripped by
other troikas,&mdash;drivers and passengers all alike white with
glittering hoar-frost, until they seemed a company of
grey-beards.&nbsp; The solid river flashed like a burnished
cuirass in the rays of the morning.&nbsp; Here the scene was
varied by a group of strangely patterned blocks and pillars;
there a fountain gracefully shooting upwards with shapely Ionic
and Doric columns, reflected a myriad prismatic hues from its
diamond-like stalactites.&nbsp; <a name="page331"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 331</span>Here a broken Gothic arch overhung
the shining highway; there an Egyptian obelisk lay half buried
beneath the snow.&nbsp; Such were the fantastic shapes into which
the strong wind had moulded the ice as it was rapidly formed.</p>
<p>Regaining the main road, Major Burnaby and his companion sped
on towards Samara.&nbsp; Their first halting-place was a
farmhouse, called Nijny Pegersky Hootor, twenty-five versts from
Sizeran, where some men were winnowing corn after a fashion of
antediluvian simplicity.&nbsp; Throwing the corn high up into the
air with a shovel, they allowed the wind to blow away the husks,
and the grain fell upon a carpet laid out to catch it.&nbsp; As
for the farmhouse, it was a square wooden building, containing
two low but spacious rooms.&nbsp; A large stove of dried clay was
so placed as to warm both apartments; and above it, a platform of
boards, not more than three feet from the ceiling, supplied the
family with sleeping accommodation.&nbsp; On the outside of the
building a heavy wooden door opened into a small portico, at one
end of which stood the obraz, or image&mdash;as usual an
appendage to a Russian house, as were the Lares and Penates, or
household gods, to a Roman house.&nbsp; The obrazye are made of
different patterns, but usually represent a saint or the Trinity;
they are executed in silver-gilt on brass relief, and adorned
with all kinds of gewgaws.</p>
<p>A fresh team having been obtained, the travellers resumed
their journey; but the cold had increased, the wind blew more
furiously, and their suffering was severe.&nbsp; In thick flakes
fell the constant snow, and the driver had much ado to keep the
track, while the <a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>half-fed horses floundered along heavily, and
frequently sank up to the traces in the gathering drift.&nbsp;
The cracks of the whip resounded from their jaded flanks like
pistol-shots.&nbsp; With sarcastic apostrophes the driver
endeavoured to stimulate their progress:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sons of animals!&rdquo; (whack!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, spoiled one!&rdquo; (whack!)&nbsp; This to a poor,
attenuated brute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, woolly ones!&rdquo; (whack, whack, whack!)&nbsp;
Here all were upset into a snow-drift, the sleigh being
three-parts overturned, and the driver flung in an opposite
direction.</p>
<p>The sleigh was righted; the travellers once more took their
seats; and on through the darkening day they drove, until they
came to a long straggling village, where the horses stopped
before a detached cottage.&nbsp; Benumbed with the bitter cold,
Major Burnaby and his companion dashed inside, and made haste, in
front of a blazing stove, to restore the suspended
circulation.&nbsp; Then, while the women of the house made tea in
a samovar, or urn, they unfroze in the stove some cutlets and
bread which they had carried with them, and proceeded to enjoy a
hearty repast.&nbsp; In one hour&rsquo;s time they were ready to
start; but their driver demurred.&nbsp; The snowstorm was heavy;
wolves prowled along the track; the river ice might give
way.&nbsp; It was better to wait until the morning, when, with
beautiful horses, they might go like birds to the next
station.&nbsp; The two travellers could do nothing with him, and
were compelled to resign themselves to pass the night on the hard
boards, in an atmosphere infested by many unpleasant
smells.&nbsp; A good hour before sunrise all <a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>were again
in motion.&nbsp; The Major and his companion abandoned their
heavy troika, and engaged two small sleighs with a pair of horses
to each, one for themselves and one to carry their luggage.</p>
<p>It was a glorious winter morning, and the sun came forth like
a bridegroom to run his course, invested with indescribable pomp
of colour.&nbsp; First, over the whole of the eastern horizon
extended a pale blue streak, which seemed, like a wall, to shut
off the vast Beyond.&nbsp; Suddenly its summit changed into rare
lapis-lazuli, while its base became a sheet of purple.&nbsp; From
the darker lines shot wondrous waves of grey and crystal; and in
time the purple foundations upheaved into glowing seas of
fire.&nbsp; The wall broke up into castles, battlements, and
towers&mdash;all with magical gleams, which gradually floated far
away, while the seas of flame, lighting up the whole horizon,
burst through their borders and swelled into a mighty
ocean.&nbsp; The sight was one on which the eye of man could
scarcely gaze.&nbsp; The sunny expanse of the winter-bound earth
reflected as in a mirror the celestial panorama.&nbsp; Shafts of
light seemed to dart in rapid succession from earth to sky, until
at last the vast luminous orb of day rose from the depth of the
many-coloured radiance, and with its surpassing glory put
everything else to shame.</p>
<p>The travellers reached Samara&mdash;a well-built prosperous
town, situated on a tributary of the Volga.&nbsp; There Major
Burnaby parted from his companion, whose road thenceforward lay
in a different direction, and proceeded to make his preparations
for a drive across the steppes to Orenburg.</p>
<p><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>He
started next morning, in a sleigh which he had purchased, and had
caused to be well repaired, and took the road towards
Orenburg.&nbsp; The country was flat and uninteresting; buried
beneath a white shroud of sand, with a few trees scattered here
and there, and at intervals a dreary-looking hut or two.&nbsp;
The first post-station, for changing horses, was
Smeveshlaevskaya, twenty versts (a verst is two-thirds of an
English mile); the next, Bodrovsky, where Burnaby arrived a
little after sunset.&nbsp; After drinking a few glasses of tea to
fortify himself against the increasing cold (25&deg; below zero,
R.), he pushed forward in the hope of reaching Malomalisky, about
twenty-six and a half versts, about nine p.m.&nbsp; But plunging
into the heart of a terrible snowstorm, he and his driver were so
blinded and beaten, and the horses so jaded by the swiftly
forming snow-drifts, that he was compelled to give the order to
return, and to pass the night at Bodrovsky.</p>
<p>At daybreak the resolute guardsman was on his way.&nbsp; In
the course of the day he fell in with General Kryjonovsky, the
governor of the Orenburg district, who was bound for St.
Petersburg; and a brief conversation with him showed that the
authorities, as he had suspected, by no means approved of his
expedition to Khiva.&nbsp; At one of the stations, the man
assigned to him as driver had been married only the day before,
and undertook his duties with obvious reluctance.&nbsp; His sole
desire was to return as quickly as possible to his bride, and
with this intent he lashed his horses until they kicked and
jumped in the most furious contortions.&nbsp; The Major was
thrown in the air, and caught again by the rebound; <a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>upset,
righted, and upset again; gun, saddle-bags, cartridge-cases, and
traveller, all simultaneously flying in the air.&nbsp; After a
third of these rough experiences, the Major resolved to try the
effect of a sharp application of his boot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you do that?&rdquo; said the driver, pulling up
his horse.&nbsp; &ldquo;You hurt, you break my ribs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only do to you what you do to me,&rdquo; replied the
Major.&nbsp; &ldquo;You hurt, you break my ribs, and injure my
property besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir of noble birth,&rdquo; ejaculated the fellow,
&ldquo;it is not my fault.&nbsp; It is thine, oh moody
one!&rdquo; to his offside horse, accompanied by a crack from his
whip.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is thine, oh spoilt and cherished
one!&rdquo; to his other meagre and half-starved quadruped
(whack!) &ldquo;Oh, petted and caressed sons of animals&rdquo;
(whack, whack, whack!), &ldquo;I will teach you to upset the
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At length, after a journey of four hundred versts, Orenburg
was reached.&nbsp; At this frontier town, situated almost on the
verge of civilization, our traveller was compelled to make a
short sojourn.&nbsp; He had letters of introduction to present,
which procured him some useful friends; a servant to engage,
provisions to purchase, information to collect about the route to
Khiva, and his English gold and notes to convert into Russian
coin.&nbsp; Through the good offices of a Moslem gentleman, he
was able to engage a Tartar, named Nazar&mdash;not five feet
high&mdash;as a servant; and after some delay he obtained from
the military chief a podorojoraya, or passport, as far as Kasala,
or Fort No. 1.&nbsp; This pass ran as follows: &ldquo;By the <a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>order of
His Majesty the Emperor Alexander, the son of Nicolas, Autocrat
of the whole of Russia, etc., etc.&nbsp; From the town of Orsk to
the town of Kasala, to the Captain of the English service,
Frederick, the son of Gustavus Burnaby, to give three horses,
with a driver, for the legal fare, without delay.&nbsp; Given in
the town of Orenburg, 15th December, 1875.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, Frederick, &ldquo;the son of Gustavus
Burnaby,&rdquo; with his Tartar servant, took their departure
from Orenburg, and in a few minutes were trotting along the
frozen surface of the river Ural.&nbsp; Every now and then they
fell in with a caravan of rough, shaggy, undersized camels,
drawing sleighs laden with cotton from Tashkent; or a Cossack
galloped by, brandishing his long spear; or a ruddy-faced Kirghiz
slowly caracolled over the shining snow.&nbsp; Three stations
were passed in safety, and Burnaby resolved on halting at the
fourth, Krasnojorsk, for refreshment.&nbsp; But as the afternoon
closed in, the Tartar driver began to lash his weary jades
impatiently; as an excuse for his vehemence, pointing to the
clouds that were rising before them, and the signs of a gathering
snowstorm.&nbsp; Soon the air was filled with flakes; the
darkness rapidly increased; the driver lost his way, and, at
length, the team came to a standstill, breast deep in a
snow-drift.&nbsp; What was to be done?&nbsp; It was equally
impossible to go forward or to return; there was no wood in the
neighbourhood with which to kindle a fire, no shovel with which
to make a snow house; nothing could the belated wayfarer do but
endure the bitter cold and the silent darkness, and wait for
morning.&nbsp; Burnaby suffered much from the exposure, but the
great <a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>difficulty was to prevent himself from yielding to the
fatal lethargy which extreme cold induces&mdash;from falling into
that sleep which turns inevitably into death.&nbsp; How he
rejoiced when the day broke, and he was able to despatch the
driver on one of the horses for assistance; and how he rejoiced
when the man returned with three post horses and some peasants,
and the road was regained, and the journey resumed, and the
station reached at last!&nbsp; There they rested and refreshed
themselves, before, with invigorated spirits, they dashed once
again into the snow-bound depths of the steppes.</p>
<p>After a while the aspect of the country grew more
cheery.&nbsp; The low chain of mountains to the north-east was
sometimes abruptly broken, and a prominent peak thrust its summit
into the interval.&nbsp; Through the fleecy snow various coloured
grasses were visible.&nbsp; Olive-tinted branches, and dark
forests of fir and pine, contrasted strongly with the whitely
shining expanse that spread as far as the eye could see.&nbsp;
Spider-like webs of frozen dew hung from the branches.&nbsp; The
thin icicles glistened like prisms with all the colours of the
rainbow.&nbsp; Thus, through a succession of fairy landscapes,
such as the dwellers in Western lands can form but a faint idea
of, the travellers dashed onward to Orsk.</p>
<p>Then the face of the country underwent another change.&nbsp;
They were fairly in the region of the steppes&mdash;those wide
and level plains which, during the brief summer, bloom with
luxuriant vegetation, and are alive with the flocks and herds of
the nomads, but in the long drear winter, from north to south and
east to west, are buried deep beneath frozen snow.&nbsp; <a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>Wherever
you direct your gaze it rests upon snow, snow, still snow;
shining with a painful glare in the mid-day sun; fading into a
dull, grey, melancholy ocean as noon lapses into twilight.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A picture of desolation which wearies by its utter
loneliness, and at the same time appals by its immensity; a
circle of which the centre is everywhere, and the circumference
nowhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; Travel, in this world-beyond-the-world, in
this solitude which Frost and Winter make all their own, tests
the courage and endurance of a man, for it makes no appeal to the
imagination or the fancy, it charms the eye with no pleasant
pictures, suggests no associations to the mind.&nbsp; But it has
its dangers, as Major Burnaby experienced.&nbsp; He had left the
station of Karabootak (three hundred and seventeen miles from
Orsk), and as the road was comparatively smooth, and the wind had
subsided, he leaned back in his sleigh and fell asleep.&nbsp;
Unluckily he had forgotten to put on his thick gloves, and his
hands, slipping from the fur-lined sleeves of his pelisse, lay
exposed to the full potency of the cold air.&nbsp; In a few
minutes he awoke with a feeling of intense pain; and looking at
his hands, he saw that the finger-nails were blue, blue too the
fingers and back of the hands, while the wrists and lower part of
the arms had assumed the hue of wax.&nbsp; They were
frost-bitten!&nbsp; He called his servant, and made him rub the
skin with some snow in the hope of restoring the vitality.&nbsp;
This he did for some minutes; but, meanwhile, the pain gradually
ascended up the arms, while the lower portion of the arms was
dead to all feeling, all sensation.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is no
good,&rdquo; said Nazar, looking sorrowfully at his master;
&ldquo;we must drive on as fast as possible to the
station.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>The
station was some miles off.&nbsp; Miles?&nbsp; Each mile seemed
to the tortured traveller a league; each league a day&rsquo;s
journey; the physical pain consumed him, wore him down as mental
anguish might have done.&nbsp; But at last the station was
reached; Burnaby sprang from the sleigh, rushed into the
waiting-room, and to three Cossacks whom he met there showed his
hands.&nbsp; Straightway they conducted him into an outer
apartment, took off his coat, bared his arms, and plunged him
into a tub of ice and water up to the shoulders.&nbsp; He felt
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said the eldest of the soldiers,
shaking his head, &ldquo;it is a bad job; you will lose your
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will drop off,&rdquo; remarked another, &ldquo;if
we cannot get back the circulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any spirit with you?&rdquo; asked a third.</p>
<p>Nazar, on hearing this inquiry, immediately ran out, and
returned with a tin bottle containing naphtha for cooking
purposes; upon which the Cossacks, taking the Major&rsquo;s arms
out of the icy water, proceeded to rub them with the strong
spirit.</p>
<p>Rub, rub, rub; the skin peeled under their horny hands, and
the spirit irritated the membrane below.&nbsp; At last a faint
sensation like tickling&mdash;we are using the Major&rsquo;s own
words&mdash;pervaded the elbow-joints, and he slightly
flinched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo; asked the eldest Cossack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital, brothers,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;rub as
hard as you can;&rdquo; and after continuing the friction until
the flesh was almost flayed, they suddenly plunged his arms again
into the ice and water.&nbsp; This time, the pain was sharp.</p>
<p><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; exclaimed the Cossacks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The more it hurts, the better chance you have of saving
your hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; And after a short time they let him
remove his arms from the tub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are fortunate, little father,&rdquo; said the
eldest Cossack.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it had not been for the spirit
your hands would have dropped off, even if you had not lost your
arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rough, kind-hearted fellows were these poor
soldiers,&rdquo; adds Major Burnaby; &ldquo;and when I forced on
the oldest of them a present for himself and comrades, the old
soldier simply said, &lsquo;Are we not all brothers when in
misfortune?&nbsp; Would you not have helped me if I had been in
the same predicament?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Major shook his hand heartily, and retired to the
waiting-room to rest upon the sofa, as the physical shock he had
undergone had for the moment thoroughly prostrated him.&nbsp;
Moreover, his arms were sore and inflamed, the spirit having in
some places penetrated the raw flesh; and several weeks elapsed
before he thoroughly recovered from the effects of his
carelessness.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At Terekli, about five hundred miles from Orenburg, our
traveller entered the province of Turkistan, and found himself in
the region which acknowledges the authority of General
Kauffmann&mdash;a restless and ambitious soldier, to whose energy
much of Russia&rsquo;s recent advance eastward would seem to be
due.&nbsp; He still pushed forward with characteristic
resolution, braving the terrors of the climate and the dangers of
the road in his determined purpose to reach Khiva.&nbsp; At one
station no horses were to be obtained, and, instead, <a
name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>three
gigantic camels were harnessed to the tiny sleigh.&nbsp; A
strange spectacle!&nbsp; &ldquo;I have tried many ways of
locomotion in my life, from fire-balloons to bicycles, from
canoes and bullocks to cows, camels, and donkeys; whilst in the
East the time-honoured sedan of our grandfathers has occasionally
borne me and my fortunes; but never had I travelled in so comical
a fashion.&nbsp; A Tartar rode the centre camel.&nbsp; His
head-gear would have called attention, if nothing else had, for
he wore a large black hat, which reminded me of an inverted
coal-scuttle, whilst a horn-like protuberance sticking out from
its summit gave a diabolical appearance to his lobster-coloured
visage.&nbsp; The hat, which was made of sheepskin, had the white
wool inside, which formed a striking contrast to the flaming
countenance of the excited Tartar.&nbsp; He had replaced the
usual knout used for driving, by a whip armed with a thin cord
lash, and he urged on his ungainly team more by the shrill sounds
of his voice than by any attempt at flagellation, the Tartar
seldom being able to get more than four miles an hour from the
lazy brutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of a sudden the camel in the centre quickly
stopped, and the rider was precipitated head-over-heels in the
snow.&nbsp; Luckily, it was soft falling; there were no bones
broken, and in a minute or two he was again in the saddle, having
changed the system of harnessing, and placed one of the camels as
leader, whilst the other two were driven as wheelers.&nbsp; We
got on very fairly for a little while, when the foremost of our
train having received a rather sharper application of the lash
than he deemed expedient remonstrated with his rider by lying
down.&nbsp; Coaxing <a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>and persuasion were now used; he was
promised the warmest of stalls, the most delicious of water, if
he would only get up.&nbsp; But this the beast absolutely
declined to do, until the cold from the snow striking against his
body induced him to rise from the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We now went even slower than before.&nbsp; Our driver
was afraid to use his whip for fear of another ebullition of
temper on the part of the delinquent, and confined himself to
cracking his whip in the air.&nbsp; The sounds of this proceeding
presently reaching the ears of the leader, perhaps made him think
that his companions were undergoing chastisement.&nbsp; Anyhow,
it appeared to afford him some satisfaction, for, quickening his
stride, he compelled his brethren behind to accelerate their
pace; and after a long, wearisome drive we arrived at our
destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the influence of milder weather the aspect of the
country rapidly modified and brightened, and instead of a uniform
sheet of frozen snow, broad patches of vegetation met the
eye.&nbsp; On these the Kirghiz horses were browsing with evident
delight.&nbsp; How they live through the winter is a mystery, as
their owners seldom feed them with corn, and they are compelled
to trust to the scanty grasses which may still be partially alive
underneath the snow.&nbsp; Nor are they in any way protected from
the cold.&nbsp; As a necessary consequence, the spring finds them
reduced to mere skeletons, whose ribs are barely covered by their
parchment-like skin; but they soon gain in flesh and strength
when once the rich pasturage of the steppes is at their
disposal.&nbsp; Their powers of endurance are wonderful; and
without rest, or water, or food, they will accomplish surprising
distances, maintaining a <a name="page343"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>first-rate speed.&nbsp; An instance
is on record of a Kirghiz chief having galloped two hundred
miles, over a rocky and mountainous ground, in twenty-four
hours.&nbsp; A Russian detachment of cavalry, mounted on Kirghiz
horses, marched 333 miles in six days.</p>
<p>Major Burnaby was soon apprised that he was nearing the Sea
(or Lake) of Aral by the salt breeze which blew persistently in
his face.&nbsp; The whole district for miles around was
impregnated with salt, and the springs and streams had all a
brackish taste and strong saline flavour.&nbsp; At Nicolaivskaya
his road touched close upon the north-eastern extremity of the
sea.&nbsp; This great inland basin of brackish water is separated
from the Caspian by the dense plateau of Ust-Urt.&nbsp; It
measures about 260 miles from north to south, and 125 from east
to west.&nbsp; On the north-east it receives the waters of the
Syr-Daria, or Jaxartes; on the south-east those of the Amu-Daria,
or Oxus.&nbsp; As it is on the same level with the Caspian, we
may reasonably suppose that both seas were at one time
connected.&nbsp; Owing to the excessive evaporation which takes
place, it is understood to be decreasing in size.</p>
<p>At Kasala, or Fort No. 1, our traveller struck the Syr-Daria,
some forty or fifty miles above its outlet in the Aral.&nbsp;
Kasala is inhabited by nomad Kirghiz, who pitch their kibitkas in
its outskirts in the winter, to resume their migratory life with
the first breath of spring; by Russian and Tartar merchants, who
dwell in one-storied houses, built of brick or cement; and by a
motley population of Greeks, Khivans, Bokharans, Tashkentians,
and Turcomans generally, attracted thither by the hope of <a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>gain.&nbsp;
Owing to its geographical position, it is the centre of a
considerable trade; for all goods to Orenburg from Western
Turkistan must pass through it.&nbsp; Its civil population
numbers about 5000 souls; its garrison consists of about 350
infantry and 400 cavalry, and it is also the head-quarters in
winter of the sailors of the Aral fleet, which is made up of four
small steamers of light draught.&nbsp; As for the fort, it is
simply an earthwork, constructed in the shape of a half-star,
with a bastion on the south extending to the bank of the
Syr-Daria.&nbsp; A dry ditch, thirty feet broad by twelve feet
deep, and a parapet, eight feet high and twelve feet thick,
surround it.&nbsp; Sufficiently strong to overawe the Kirghiz, it
could offer no effective resistance to an European force.</p>
<p>Major Burnaby paid a visit to a Kirghiz kibitka, or tent, and
his description of it may be compared with Mr.
Atkinson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Inside it was adorned with thick carpets
of various hues, and bright-coloured cushions, for the
accommodation of the inmates.&nbsp; In the centre a small fire
gave out a cloud of white smoke, which rose in coils and wreaths
to the roof, and there escaped through an aperture left for the
purpose.&nbsp; The fuel used is saxaul, the wood of the bramble
tree, and it emits an acrid, pungent odour.&nbsp; The women in
the tent had their faces uncovered; they received their visitor
with a warm welcome, and spread some rugs for him to sit down by
their side.&nbsp; They were all of them moon-faced, with large
mouths, but good eyes and teeth.</p>
<p>The master of the kibitka, who was clad in a long brown robe,
thickly wadded to keep out the cold, <a name="page345"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 345</span>poured some water into a large
caldron, and proceeded to make tea, while a young girl handed
round raisins and dried currants.&nbsp; A brief conversation then
arose.&nbsp; The Kirghiz were much surprised to learn that their
visitor was not a Russian, but had come from a far Western land,
and were even more surprised to find that he had brought no wife
with him&mdash;a wife, in the opinion of the Kirghiz, being as
indispensable to a man&rsquo;s happiness as a horse or
camel.&nbsp; In entering into matrimony, the Kirghiz have one
great advantage over the other Moslem races; they see the girls
whom they wish to marry, and are allowed to converse with them
before the bargain is concluded between the parents, one hundred
sheep being the average price given for a young woman.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the 12th of January Major Burnaby left Kasala for
Khiva.&nbsp; His retinue consisted of three camels, loaded with a
tent, forage, and provisions, his Tartar servant, who bestrode
the largest camel, and a Kirghiz guide, who, like himself, was
mounted on horseback.&nbsp; His provisions included stchi, or
cabbage soup, with large pieces of meat cut up in it, which,
having been poured into two large iron stable buckets, had become
hard frozen, so that it could be easily carried slung on a
camel&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; He also took with him twenty pounds of
cooked meat.&nbsp; A hatchet, to chop up the meat or cut down
brushwood for a fire, and a cooking lamp, with a supply of
spirit, formed part of his equipment.</p>
<p>Crossing the icy surface of the Syr-Daria, our traveller once
more plunged into the solitude of the <a name="page346"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 346</span>steppes, bravely facing the
storm-wind and the ridges of snow which rolled before it, like
the wave-crests of a frozen sea.&nbsp; After a five hours&rsquo;
march, he called a halt, that the camels might rest and be
fed&mdash;for they will feed only in the daytime; wherefore it is
wise to march them as much as possible during the night.&nbsp;
Their ordinary pace is about two miles and a third in an hour;
and the best plan is to start at midnight, unload them for about
two hours in the day to feed, and halt at sunset: thus securing
sixteen hours&rsquo; work per day, and accomplishing a daily
journey of at least thirty-seven miles.</p>
<p>The kibitka was soon raised.&nbsp; &ldquo;Imagine,&rdquo; says
our traveller, &ldquo;a bundle of sticks, each five feet three
inches in length, and an inch in diameter; these are connected
with each other by means of cross sticks, through the ends of
which holes are bored, and leather thongs passed.&nbsp; This
allows plenty of room for all the sticks to open out freely; they
then form a complete circle, about twelve feet in diameter, and
five feet three in height.&nbsp; They do not require any pressing
into the ground, for the circular shape keeps them steady.&nbsp;
When this is done, a thick piece of cashmar, or cloth made of
sheep&rsquo;s wool, is suspended from their tops, and reaches to
the ground.&nbsp; This forms a shield through which the wind
cannot pass.&nbsp; Another bundle of sticks is then
produced.&nbsp; They are all fastened at one end to a small
wooden cross, about six inches long by four broad; a man standing
in the centre of the circle raises up this bundle in the air, the
cross upwards, and hitches their other ends by means of little
leather loops one by one on the different upright sticks which
form the circular walls.&nbsp; <a name="page347"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 347</span>The result is, they all pull against
each other, and are consequently self-supporting; another piece
of cloth is passed round the outside of this scaffolding, leaving
a piece uncovered at the top to allow the smoke to escape.&nbsp;
One stick is removed from the uprights which form the
walls.&nbsp; This constitutes a door, and the kibitka is
complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Major and his followers were enjoying a meal of rice
and mutton, and a glass of hot tea, three Khivans rode up to
them&mdash;a merchant and his two servants.&nbsp; The Khivan
merchant was strongly built, and about five feet ten inches in
height.&nbsp; He wore a tall, conical black Astrakhan hat; an
orange-coloured dressing-gown, thickly quilted, and girt about
the loins with a long, red sash; and over all, enveloping him
from hand to foot, a heavy sheepskin mantle.&nbsp; His weapons
consisted of a long, single-barrelled gun, and a short, richly
mounted sabre.&nbsp; An exchange of civilities followed, and then
both parties retired to rest.&nbsp; At about three o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, after some difficulty with his guide and
camel-driver, the Major resumed his march, and for six hours the
weary tramp and toil over the frost-bound plain continued.&nbsp;
At nine a halt was called, soup was made, and the party
breakfasted.&nbsp; By the time they were ready to set out again,
the Khivan merchant&rsquo;s caravan had come up, and all went on
together.</p>
<p>In advance rode the guide, singing a song in praise of mutton,
and descriptive of his partiality for that succulent meat.&nbsp;
The Kirghiz poets make the sheep the special subject of their
metrical eulogium; in truth, it fills in their poetry as
conspicuous a place as <a name="page348"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 348</span>the dove in the love-songs of the
Latin bards.&nbsp; Nor is to be wondered at.&nbsp; The sheep
represents the wealth, the property of the nomads.&nbsp; During
the summer and autumn they live upon their milk, and never think
of killing them except to do honour to a guest by serving up
before him a leg of mutton.&nbsp; In the winter they are, of
course, obliged very frequently to sacrifice the highly esteemed
animal, but they live upon horseflesh and camel&rsquo;s flesh as
much as they can.&nbsp; Their clothing is furnished by the sheep,
being made entirely of sheep&rsquo;s wool wrought into a coarse
homespun.&nbsp; Finally, if they want to buy a horse, a camel, or
a wife, they pay in sheep; and a man&rsquo;s worth in the world
is reckoned by the numbers of his flock.</p>
<p>On the following day, in the course of their march, the
travellers came upon a Kirghiz encampment, the members of which
were considerably excited by Major Burnaby&rsquo;s announcement
of his desire to purchase a whole sheep.&nbsp; The head of the
principal kibitka, accompanied by a pretty Kirghiz girl, hastened
to conduct him to the sheepfold, that he might select an animal,
and the fattest of the flock became his for the small sum of four
roubles.&nbsp; The pretty young girl acted as butcher, receiving
the skin and head in acknowledgment of her trouble, and the
carcase was conveyed to the Major&rsquo;s tent, where it was duly
cooked, and devoured by his followers, who showed the most
intense appreciation of his liberality.</p>
<p>The march being resumed, Major Burnaby made for a place called
Kalenderhana, instead of the Russian settlement of
Petro-Alexandrovsky, having a shrewd suspicion that if he went
thither, as the <a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>governor of Kasala had desired, he would, in some way
or other, be prevented from reaching Khiva.&nbsp; Pushing forward
steadily, he left his Khivan merchant far behind, and strode
across an undulating country in the direction of
south-south-west.&nbsp; Next he came into a salt district, barren
and dreary; and afterwards reached the desert of Jana-Daria, the
dried-up bed of a river, which is lost in the sand.&nbsp; Still
continuing his march, he came upon an unbounded ocean of sand,
which, in the glaring sunshine, glittered like a sea of molten
gold.&nbsp; When this was traversed, the country grew pleasanter
and more fertile.&nbsp; Traces of game appeared.&nbsp; Sometimes
a brown hare darted through the herbage; while in the distance
herds of saigak, or antelopes, bounded with elastic tread across
the sward.&nbsp; A chain of mountains running east and west rose
up before the wanderer&rsquo;s path, and presented a picturesque
spectacle, with their broken crests, sharp pinnacles, and masses
of shining quartz.&nbsp; Upon their rugged sides could be traced
the furrows ploughed by the torrents which the spring lets loose
and feeds with its abundant rains.&nbsp; Through a dark and deep
defile, about seven miles long, the little company penetrated the
mountain barrier of the Kazan-Tor, and descended into a broad
plain, overspread by a network of canals for irrigation, where a
striking indication of the desultory but ceaseless hostilities
waged between the Kirghiz and the Turcomans was presented in the
rude fortifications, a high ditch and a wattled palisade, that
encircled every little village.&nbsp; Kalenderhana was fortified
in this manner.&nbsp; Here Major Burnaby was warmly welcomed, and
in great state escorted to his Kirghiz <a
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>guide&rsquo;s house, or kibitka, where a curious throng
quickly surrounded him, and proceeded to examine, and comment
unreservedly upon, every part of his attire.&nbsp; Major Burnaby,
if less outspoken, was not less curious, and carefully noted that
the hostess was a good-looking woman, clad in a flowing white
dressing-gown, with a whiter turban, folded many times around her
small head.&nbsp; The brother-in-law, a short hump-backed fellow,
had a horse to sell, which Major Burnaby expressed his
willingness to purchase, if he went to Khiva.&nbsp; The guide had
been ordered by the Russian governor of Kasala to conduct the
Englishman to Petro-Alexandrovsky, and at first he was reluctant
to run the risk of punishment; but the domestic pressure put upon
him could not be resisted, and he agreed to go to Khiva, on
condition that the Major completed his bargain with the
horse-dealer.&nbsp; This was at last arranged, and a Tartar being
sent forward with a letter to the Khan, requesting permission to
visit his capital, the traveller resumed his journey, with Nazar
proudly seated astride the new purchase.</p>
<p>A brief ride carried them to the bank of the great Amu-Daria,
the Oxus of Alexander the Great, which at this time was frozen
over, presenting a solid highway of ice, half a mile in
breadth.&nbsp; There they met with some Khivan
merchants&mdash;stalwart men, with dark complexions and large
eyes, dressed in long red thickly wadded dressing-gowns and
cone-shaped black lambskin hats.&nbsp; A caravan of camels was
crossing the river, and numerous arbas, or two-wheeled carts,
each drawn by one horse, passed to and fro.&nbsp; Every man whom
they encountered saluted them with the <a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>customary
Arab greeting, &ldquo;<i>Salam aaleikom</i>!&rdquo; to which the
response was always given, &ldquo;<i>Aaleikom
salam</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon after crossing the frozen river,
Major Burnaby determined to halt for the night; and the guide
began to look about for suitable quarters.&nbsp; He pulled up at
last by the side of a large, substantial-looking square building,
built of clay.&nbsp; A rap at the high wooden gates brought out
an old man bent nearly double with age, who, on hearing that the
travellers wanted a night&rsquo;s hospitality, immediately called
to his servants to take charge of the horses and camels, and
across the square-walled courtyard ushered Major Burnaby into his
house.&nbsp; The guest-room was spacious and lofty.&nbsp; One end
of it was covered with thick carpets; this was the place of
honour for visitors.&nbsp; In the centre a small square hearth
was filled with charcoal embers, confined within a coping about
three inches high.&nbsp; On the coping stood a richly chased
copper ewer&mdash;which might have been dug out of the ruins of
the buried Pompeii, so classic was it in shape and
appearance&mdash;with a long swan-like neck, constructed so as to
assist the attendant in pouring water over the hands of his
master&rsquo;s guests before they began their repast.&nbsp; On
one side of the hearth was a square hole about three feet deep,
filled with water, and reached by a couple of steps.&nbsp; It was
the place of ablution&mdash;something like the <i>impluvium</i>
in a Roman villa&mdash;and its sides were lined with ornamental
tiles.&nbsp; The windows were represented by two narrow slits,
each about two feet long by six inches wide, while some open
wooden trellis-work supplied the place of glass.</p>
<p>After a brief absence the host reappeared, carrying <a
name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>in his hand
a large earthenware dish full of rice and mutton, while his
servants followed, with baskets of bread and hard-boiled
eggs.&nbsp; A pitcher of milk was also produced, and an enormous
melon, weighing quite twenty-five pounds.&nbsp; When the host and
his visitor had completed their repast, they began to converse,
the Khivan asking many questions about the countries which the
Englishman had travelled.&nbsp; To his inquiry whether there were
camels in England, Major Burnaby replied with an amusing
description of our railways and locomotives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have trains,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;composed of
arbas with iron wheels; they run upon long strips of iron, which
are laid upon the ground for the wheels to roll over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the horses drag them very fast?&rdquo; asked the
Khivan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not use live horses, but we make a horse of iron
and fill him with water, and put fire under the water.&nbsp; The
water boils and turns into steam.&nbsp; The steam is very
powerful; it rushes out of the horse&rsquo;s stomach, and turns
large wheels which we give him instead of legs.&nbsp; The wheels
revolve over the iron lines which we have previously laid down,
and the horse, which we call an engine, moves very quickly,
dragging the arbas behind him; they are made of wood and iron,
and have four wheels, not two, like your arbas in Khiva.&nbsp;
The pace is so great that if your Khan had an iron horse and a
railway, he could go to Kasala in one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning, after remunerating his host for his hospitality,
Major Burnaby proceeded towards the goal of his daring
enterprise.&nbsp; He passed through <a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>the busy trading town of Oogentel,
the first in Khivan territory on the road from Kalenderhana, and,
as an Englishman, attracted the attention of the
population.&nbsp; This attention grew into wild excitement, when
he found his way to a barber, intent upon getting rid of a beard
of thirteen weeks&rsquo; growth.&nbsp; In Oogentel the people
shave their heads and not their chins; so that the
traveller&rsquo;s desire to have his chin shaved, instead of his
head, begat an extraordinary sensation.&nbsp; An increasing crowd
gathered round the barber&rsquo;s shop; moullahs (or priests),
camel-drivers, and merchants jostling one another in their
anxiety to obtain good points of view, like the London populace
on the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Show day.&nbsp; The thought occurred to
Major Burnaby that this fanatical Moslem multitude might not be
displeased if the barber cut an unbeliever&rsquo;s throat, and it
was not without a qualm he resigned himself to his hands.&nbsp;
No such catastrophe happened, however; but the barber, rendered
nervous by the accumulated gaze of hundreds of eyes, let slip the
thin strip of steel which did duty for a razor, and inflicted a
slight wound on his customer&rsquo;s cheek.&nbsp; As no soap was
used, and the substitute for a razor was innocent of
&ldquo;edge,&rdquo; the operation was sufficiently disagreeable;
and if the crowd were sorry, Major Burnaby was heartily rejoiced
when it came to an end and he was free to continue his
journey.</p>
<p>At nine versts from Oogentel he and his party crossed the
canal of the Shabbalat, and rode through a barren tract of sand
until they arrived at a cemetery.&nbsp; The tombs were made of
dried clay, and fashioned into the strangest shapes; while over
several of the <a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>larger floated banners or white flags, from poles ten
or twelve feet high, indicating the last resting-place of some
unknown and unchronicled hero.&nbsp; <i>Multi fortes vixerunt
ante Agamemnona</i>; but they have found no bard to record their
deeds of prowess in immortal verse.&nbsp; The Khivan warriors who
fell in defence of their wild father-land must sleep for ever in
nameless graves.</p>
<p>At a village called Shamahoolhur, the traveller was received
with true Khivan hospitality.&nbsp; His entertainer was a
fair-looking man, with a genial address and a hearty glance in
his dark eyes, and appeared, from his surroundings, to be
possessed of considerable wealth.&nbsp; He was a sportsman, and
kept several hawks; these birds being used in Khiva to fly at the
saigahs and hares.&nbsp; The bird strikes his victim between its
eyes with a force which stuns or confuses it, so that it can make
no resistance or attempt at escape when the hounds seize it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not hunt in this way in your country?&rdquo;
said the Khivan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we hunt foxes, but only with hounds, and we
ourselves follow on horseback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are your horses like our own?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; they are most of them stouter built, have stronger
shoulders, and are better animals; but though they can gallop
faster than your horses for a short distance, I do not think they
can last so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which do you like best, your horse or your wife?&rdquo;
inquired the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends upon the woman,&rdquo; I replied; and the
guide, here joining in the conversation, said that <a
name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>in England
they did not buy or sell their wives, and that I was not a
married man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you have not got a wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; how could I travel if I had one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you might leave her behind, and lock her up, as
our merchants do with their wives when they go on a
journey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning Major Burnaby encountered on the road the
messenger he had despatched to Khiva.&nbsp; He was accompanied by
two Khivan noblemen, one of whom courteously saluted the English
traveller, and explained that the Khan had sent him to escort him
into the city, and bid him welcome.</p>
<p>They rapidly approached the capital, and above its belt of
trees could see its glittering crown of minarets and domes.&nbsp;
The landscape round about it was very pleasant to see, with its
leafy groves, its walled orchards, and its avenues of mulberry
trees; and recalled to the traveller&rsquo;s mind the
descriptions which figure in the pages of Oriental
story-tellers.&nbsp; A swift ride brought the party to the gates
of Khiva.&nbsp; The city is built in an oblong form, and
surrounded by two walls; of which the outer is not less than
fifty feet in height, and constructed of baked bricks, with the
upper part of dried clay.&nbsp; This forms the first line of
defence.&nbsp; At a quarter of a mile within it rises the second
wall, somewhat lower than the first, and protected by a dry
ditch.&nbsp; It immediately surrounds the tower.&nbsp; The space
between the two walls is used as a market, and high above the
throng of vendors and buyers, and the press of cattle, horses,
sheep, and camels, rises the cross-beam of the ghastly gallows,
on which all people convicted of theft are executed.</p>
<p><a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>But
as we have already spoken of this now famous city, we must
confine ourselves in these pages to Major Burnaby&rsquo;s
individual adventures.&nbsp; Lodging was provided for him in the
house of his escort, and directly on his entry he was served with
refreshments.&nbsp; Afterwards he was conducted to the
bath.&nbsp; In the evening a succession of visitors arrived; and
it was late when the Major was at liberty to seek repose.</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>In the afternoon of the following day two officials arrived
from the Khan, with an escort of six men on horseback and four on
foot, to conduct the English officer to the palace.&nbsp;
Mounting his horse, he rode forth, preceded by the six horsemen,
and with an official on either side; the rear being brought up by
Nazar, with some attendants on foot, who lashed out freely with
their long whips when the staring crowd drew inconveniently near
the <i>cort&eacute;ge</i>.&nbsp; Fresh sightseers arrived every
moment, for the name of England exercises a charm and a power in
Khiva, where people are never weary of talking of the nation
which holds in fee the gorgeous Indian empire, and is regarded as
the rival and inevitable foe of the White Czar.&nbsp; The very
housetops were lined with curious eyes.&nbsp; Through the hum and
din of voices the Englishman proceeded to the Khan&rsquo;s
residence; a large building, with pillars and domes reflecting
the sun&rsquo;s rays from their bright glazed tiles.&nbsp; At the
gates stood a guard of thirty or forty men with flashing
scimitars.&nbsp; The company passed into a small <a
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>courtyard,
from which a door opened into a low passage, and this led to some
squalid corridors, terminating in a large square room, where was
seated the treasurer, with three moullahs, busily engaged in
counting up his money.&nbsp; He made a sign to the attendants,
and a large wooden box was at once pushed forward, and offered to
Major Burnaby as a seat.&nbsp; An interval of fifteen minutes, as
the playwrights say, followed.&nbsp; Then a messenger entered the
room, and announced that the Khan was at liberty to receive the
stranger.&nbsp; Away through a long corridor, and across an inner
courtyard, to the reception-hall&mdash;a large dome-shaped tent
or kibitka.&nbsp; A curtain was drawn aside, and the Englishman
found himself face to face with the celebrated Khan.</p>
<p>The portrait he draws of the Khivan potentate differs in some
particulars from that drawn by Mr. MacGahan (see p.
283):&mdash;&ldquo;He is taller than the average of his subjects,
being quite five feet ten in height, and is strongly built.&nbsp;
His face is of a broad massive type; he has a low square
forehead, large dark eyes, a short straight nose, with dilated
nostrils, and a coal-black beard and moustache.&nbsp; An enormous
mouth, with irregular but white teeth, and a chin somewhat
concealed by his beard, and not at all in character with the
otherwise determined appearance of his face, must complete the
picture.&nbsp; He did not look more than eight and twenty, and
had a pleasant genial smile, and a merry twinkle in his eye, very
unusual amongst Orientals; in fact, a Spanish expression would
describe him better than any English one I can think of.&nbsp; He
is <i>muy simpatico</i>. . . .&nbsp; The Khan was dressed in a
similar sort of costume to that <a name="page358"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 358</span>generally worn by his subjects, but
it was made of much richer materials, and a jewelled sword was
lying by his feet.&nbsp; His head was covered by a tall black
Astrakhan hat, of a sugar-loaf shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tea having been served in a small porcelain cup, the Khan
entered into conversation with his visitor, through the medium of
Nazar, a Kirghiz interpreter, and a moullah.&nbsp; At first it
turned upon the relations existing between England and Russia,
the Crimean War, the Indian Government, and other branches of
<i>la haute politique</i>; the Khan displaying a quick and clear
intelligence.&nbsp; At last he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not have a Khan at the head of
affairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Burnaby, &ldquo;a Queen; and her
Majesty is advised as to her policy by her ministers, who for the
time being are supposed to represent the opinion of the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does that opinion change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very frequently; and since your country was conquered
we have had a fresh Government, whose policy is diametrically
opposite to that held by the previous one; and in a few
years&rsquo; time we shall have another change, for in our
country, as the people advance in knowledge and wealth, they
require fresh laws and privileges.&nbsp; The result of this is,
they choose a different set of people to represent them;&rdquo;
and the Major entered on a brief exposition of constitutional
principles, which to the Khan must surely have been
unintelligible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can your Queen have a subject&rsquo;s head cut
off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not without a trial before our judges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she never has their throats cut?&rdquo; [the
Khivan punishment for murder].</p>
<p><a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
359</span>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hindostan is a very wonderful country,&rdquo; continued
the Khan; &ldquo;the envoy I sent there a few years ago <a
name="citation359"></a><a href="#footnote359"
class="citation">[359]</a> has told me of your railroads and
telegraphs; but the Russians have railroads, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Burnaby; &ldquo;we lent them money,
and our engineers have helped to make them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the Russians pay you for this?&rdquo; he
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; so far they have behaved very
honourably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there not Jews in your country like some of the
Jews at Bokhara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the richest men in England is a Jew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Russians do not take away the money from the
Jews?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the Khan said a few words to his treasurer, and then
remarked, in allusion to the tribute he pays to Russia
annually:&mdash;&ldquo;Why do they take money from me,
then?&nbsp; The Russians love money very much.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he
said this, he shook his head sorrowfully at the treasurer; and
the latter, assuming a dolorous expression, poured out with a
pitiful accent the monosyllable &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; which, in
Khivan language, seems to convey as pregnant a meaning as Lord
Burleigh&rsquo;s shake of the head in &ldquo;The
Critic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a low bow from the Khan, the interview terminated.</p>
<p>On the following day Major Burnaby visited the Khan&rsquo;s
gardens, which lie about three-quarters of a mile from the
town.&nbsp; They are five in number, surrounded by high walls of
sun-dried clay, and each from four to five acres in extent.&nbsp;
Entering one of <a name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
360</span>them, our traveller discovered that it was neatly laid
out and trimly kept.&nbsp; The fruit trees, arranged in long
avenues, were carefully cut and pruned; apple, pear, and cherry
trees abounded.&nbsp; In the spring melons are grown on a large
scale; and in the summer trellis-work arbours of vines, loaded
with grapes, afford a delightful shelter from the sun&rsquo;s
fierce glare.&nbsp; In a small summer-palace here, the Khan holds
his court in June and July, and on a raised stone da&iuml;s
outside sits to administer justice.</p>
<p>Returning to Khiva, Burnaby visited the prison and the
principal school&mdash;the invariable accompaniments of
civilization, however imperfect.&nbsp; But may we not hope that,
some day, the school will destroy the gaol, and relieve
civilization from the reproach of barbarism that still attaches
to it?&nbsp; Meanwhile, Nazar was preparing for the Major&rsquo;s
contemplated expedition to Bokhara, his tour to Merv and Meshed,
and his journey from Persia into India, and so back to
England.&nbsp; It was the 27th of January, and he had determined
to spend only one more day in Khiva.&nbsp; But his plans were
upset by an unexpected incident.&nbsp; On the morning of the
28th, just after his return from a ride through the market, he
was &ldquo;interviewed&rdquo; by two strangers, who presented him
with a letter from the commandant of Petro-Alexandrovsky, the
Russian fort he had so determinedly avoided.&nbsp; It was to the
effect that a telegram, which had been forwarded <i>vi&acirc;</i>
Tashkent, awaited him at the fort, whither he must be pleased to
repair to receive it.&nbsp; How or why any person should consider
him of importance enough to despatch a telegram so many thousands
of miles, and should go to the expense a sending it from Tashkent
<a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>where
the telegraph ends, to Khiva, a distance of nine hundred miles,
by couriers with relays of horses, Burnaby could not
understand.&nbsp; But there was no help for it.&nbsp; He must
hasten to Petro-Alexandrovsky, where he did not want to go, and
abandon his trip to Bokhara and Merv, where he very much wished
to go.&nbsp; So he paid a visit to the bazar, and afterwards took
leave of the Khan, who bestowed upon him the honourable gift of a
khalat, or dressing-gown, and on the 29th bade adieu to
Khiva.</p>
<p>He reached Petro-Alexandrovsky on the second day, and found
that the important telegram which had travelled so far was one
from the Duke of Cambridge, Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief,
requiring his immediate return to European Russia.&nbsp; He found
also that the Russian Government had given orders for his return
by the shortest route to Kasala.&nbsp; All hope of further
exploration and adventure in Central Asia had to be
abandoned.&nbsp; Before leaving Petro-Alexandrovsky, the
disappointed traveller had an opportunity of accompanying a
coursing party, and sharing in a day&rsquo;s novel sport.&nbsp;
There were horses and men of all kinds and shapes, Russians,
Bokharans, Kirghiz, short-legged men on giant steeds, and
long-legged men on short-legged horses.&nbsp; A short colonel,
said to be well versed in the pastime, acted as master of the
hunt.&nbsp; Behind him were led seven or eight greyhounds in
couples; while a stalwart Khivan bore on his elbow a hooded
falcon, graceful enough to have figured in Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s
poetical little drama.&nbsp; Amid a storm of cries and shouts and
yells, the hunters rode forward at a rattling pace, crossing a
flat open country, intersected by a ditch or two; <a
name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>until,
after an eight miles&rsquo; run, they arrived at the cover, a
narrow tract of bush and bramble-covered ground stretching down
to the bank of the frozen Oxus.&nbsp; Forming in a line, at a
distance of twenty yards from one another, the horsemen rode
through bush and bramble.&nbsp; A sharp yell from a Kirghiz, and
after a startled hare, which had left its covert, dashed
Russians, Bokharans, Englishman, and hounds.&nbsp; On they went,
down the slippery river bank, across the shining ice, towards a
dense bit of copse, where it looked as if poor puss might find an
asylum from her pursuers.&nbsp; But at this moment the falcon was
launched into the air.&nbsp; A swift swooping flight, and whir of
wings, and in a second it was perched on its victim&rsquo;s back,
while around it gathered the well-trained dogs, with open mouths
and lolling tongues, not daring to approach the quarry.&nbsp; The
master galloped up, seized the prize, and in a few minutes more
the hunt was resumed; nor did the horsemen turn their faces
homeward until five hares had rewarded their chivalrous
efforts.</p>
<p>In company with two Russian officers, and an escort of ten
Cossacks, Major Burnaby, after a pleasant sojourn at
Petro-Alexandrovsky, set out on his return to Kasala.&nbsp; As
the weather was warmer, and the snow had begun to melt, the three
officers travelled in a tarantass, drawn by six Kirghiz horses;
the said tarantass closely resembling a hansom cab which, after
its wheels have been removed, has been fastened in a
brewer&rsquo;s dray.&nbsp; It has no springs, and it runs upon
small but solid wooden wheels.&nbsp; They had gone but a few
miles before they came again into a land of snow; the horses had
to be taken out, <a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
363</span>and a couple of camels substituted.&nbsp; At night they
bivouacked, resuming their journey before daybreak.&nbsp; It was
a picturesque sight:&mdash;&ldquo;First, the Cossacks, the
barrels of their carbines gleaming in the moonlight, the vashlik
of a conical shape surmounting each man&rsquo;s low cap, and
giving a ghastly appearance to the riders.&nbsp; Their distorted
shadows were reflected on the snow beneath, and appeared like a
detachment of gigantic phantoms pursuing our little force.&nbsp;
Then the tarantass, drawn by two large camels, which slowly
ploughed their way through the heavy track, the driver nodding on
his box but half awake, the two officers in the arms of Morpheus
inside, and the heavy woodwork creaking at each stride of the
enormous quadrupeds.&nbsp; In the wake of this vehicle strode the
baggage camels.&nbsp; The officers&rsquo; servants were fast
asleep on the backs of their animals, one man lying with his face
to the tail, and snoring hard in spite of the continued movement;
another fellow lay stretched across his saddle, apparently a good
deal the worse for drink.&nbsp; He shouted out at intervals the
strains of a Bacchanalian ditty.&nbsp; Nazar, who was always
hungry, could be seen walking in the rear.&nbsp; He had kept back
a bone from the evening meal, and was gnawing it like a dog, his
strong jaws snapping as they closed on the fibrous mutton.&nbsp;
I generally remained by our bivouac fire an hour or so after the
rest of the party had marched, and seated by the side of the
glowing embers, watched the caravan as it vanished slowly in the
distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At mid-day, on the 12th of February, Burnaby and his
companions galloped across the frozen highway of the Syr-Daria,
and into the streets of Kasala, having <a
name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 364</span>ridden
three hundred and seventy one miles in exactly nine days and two
hours.&nbsp; He remained at Kasala for a few days, endeavouring
to obtain permission to return to European Russia
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Western Siberia; but his application failed, and
he was informed that the authorization he had received to travel
in Russian Asia had been cancelled.&nbsp; There was nothing to be
done, therefore, but to complete the necessary preparations for
his journey to Orenburg.&nbsp; A sleigh was hired, and amid a
chorus of farewells from his Russian acquaintances, who showed
themselves more friendly than their Government, he started on his
homeward route, having undergone some novel experiences, and seen
Khiva, but gathered no information of any value to geographers or
men of science.&nbsp; In fact, the chief interest attaching to
Major Burnaby&rsquo;s expedition is personal: it shows that he
was a man of much energy, resolution, and perseverance, and he
may fairly be complimented on the good use he made of these
qualities in his bold but unsuccessful Ride to Khiva. <a

<h2><a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>SIR
SAMUEL BAKER,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND THE SOURCES OF THE NILE.</span></h2>
<h3>I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> late years the Lake Regions of
Central Africa have offered a fertile and attractive field to the
explorer.&nbsp; The interest of the public in African discovery,
which had for some time been dormant, was revived in 1849, by the
achievements of Dr. Livingstone, who, starting from the south,
crossed the tropic of Capricorn, and penetrated to the shores of
Lake Ngami.&nbsp; In 1853 to 1856 the same great traveller traced
the course of the river Leeambye or Zamb&eacute;si, and traversed
the entire breadth of the &ldquo;black continent&rdquo; from
Angola on the west coast to Zanzibar on the east.&nbsp; In 1865
he resumed his labours, striking into the very heart of Africa,
with the view of tracing out the Sources of the Nile, and
entering into a fertile country, the resources of which he found
to be capable of immense development.&nbsp; For the first two or
three years of his absence his letters and despatches reached
England with some degree of regularity, but at length a veil of
silence fell across his path, and it began to be feared that <a
name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>he, like
other explorers, had fallen a victim to his enthusiasm.&nbsp; An
expedition in search of the missing traveller was equipped by Mr.
Gordon Bennett, proprietor of the <i>New York Herald</i>, in
1871, and placed in charge of Mr. Henry M. Stanley, who had the
good fortune to find Livingstone at Ujiji, near
Unyanyemb&eacute;, on the 10th of November.&nbsp; He remained
with him until the 14th of March, 1872, when he returned to
England with his diary and other documents.&nbsp; Dr. Livingstone
at this time reported that, in his belief, the Nile springs up
about six hundred miles to the south of the southernmost point of
Lake Victoria Nyanza.&nbsp; In November, 1872, a relief or
auxiliary expedition, under Lieutenant V. Lovett Cameron, started
from Zanzibar; but in October, 1873, while at Unyanyemb&eacute;,
its leader received the intelligence of Livingstone&rsquo;s
death, which had taken place at Ujiji, and soon afterwards the
corpse arrived in charge of his faithful followers.&nbsp; Cameron
then took up the work of exploration, and in spite of immense
difficulties, great mental and physical suffering, and obstacles
of every kind, he made his way to Lake Tanganyika, thence to
Nyangw&eacute;, and after identifying the Lualaba with the Kongo,
struck to the southward, and passing through regions hitherto
unexplored, struck the west coast at Benguela.&nbsp; As a result
of his observations, Lieutenant Cameron thus sketches the river
system of Africa:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The basin of the Nile is probably bounded on the
south-west by the watershed reached by Dr. Schweinfurth; on the
south of the Albert Nyanza, by the high lands between that lake
and the Tanganyika, whence the watershed pursues a tortuous
course to <a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
367</span>Unyanyemb&eacute; (where, I believe, the basins of the
Nile, Kongo, and Lufiji approach each other), and then follows a
wave of high land running east till it turns up northwards along
the landward slopes of the mountains dividing the littoral from
the interior.&nbsp; Passing by Mounts Kilima Njaro and Kenia, it
extends to the mountains of Abyssinia, where the sources of the
Blue Nile were discovered by Bruce [1770], and so on to the
parched plains bordering the Red Sea, where no rains ever
fall.&nbsp; The western boundary of the Nile basin is, of course,
the eastern portion of the desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The basins of the Niger and the Ogowai cannot yet be
defined with any degree of exactitude, and the northern boundary
of the basin of the Kongo has still to be traced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Zamb&eacute;si drains that portion of the continent
south of the Kongo system, and north of the Kalahari desert and
the Limpopo, the northern boundary of the Transvaal Republic;
some of its affluents reaching to within two hundred and fifty
miles of the west coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mighty Kongo, king of all the African rivers, and
second only to the Amazon (and perhaps to the Yang-tse-Kiang) in
the volume of its waters, occupies a belt of the continent lying
on both sides of the equator, but most probably the larger area
belongs to the southern hemisphere.&nbsp; Many of its affluents
fork into those of the Zamb&eacute;si on a level tableland, where
the watershed is so tortuous that it is hard to trace it, and
where, during the rainy season, floods extend right across
between the head-waters of the two streams.</p>
<p><a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>&ldquo;The Kelli, discovered by Dr. Schweinfurth, may
possibly prove to be the Lowa, reported to me as a large affluent
of the Lualaba [or Kongo] to the west of Nyangw&eacute;; or, if
not an affluent of the Lualaba, it most probably flows either to
the Ogowai or the Tchadda, an affluent of the Niger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1874 another expedition of discovery was fitted out, at the
joint expense of the proprietors of the London <i>Daily
Telegraph</i> and the <i>New York Herald</i>, and Mr. H. M.
Stanley was appointed to the command.&nbsp; In 1875 he reached
Lake Victoria Nyanza, and through the good offices of Mtesa, King
of Uganda, obtained a flotilla of canoes, with which he
circumnavigated the lake.&nbsp; It proved to be the largest basin
of fresh water in the world, occupying the immense area of sixty
thousand square miles.&nbsp; Mr. Stanley next pushed on to Lake
Albert Nyanza; afterwards circumnavigated the northern half of
Lake Tanganyika; struck westward to the Lualaba at Nyangw&eacute;
(1876), and thence descended the Lualaba as far as the Isangila
Falls (June, 1877), whence he crossed the country to Kalinda, on
the west coast.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But we must now return to 1857, when Captains Burton and
Speke, under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society of
London, started from Zanzibar to explore the inland lacustrine
region; and discovered, to the south of the equator, Lake
Tanganyika, which they partially explored in a couple of
canoes.&nbsp; Captain Burton being taken ill, Speke pushed on to
the north alone, and discovered the immense basin now known as
the Victoria Nyanza, which he immediately conceived to be the
great <a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>reservoir and head-waters of the Nile.&nbsp; To
ascertain the truth of this supposition, he started again from
the east coast in October, 1860, accompanied by Captain Grant;
crossed the great equatorial table-land of the interior; reached
the Victoria Nyanza; skirted its shores until they discovered its
main outlet, which proved to be the Nile, and then traced the
course of the famous river to Gondokoro, whence, by way of
Assouan, Thebes, and Cairo, they proceeded to Alexandria.&nbsp;
Their well-directed energy had to a great extent solved the
geographical problem of ages, and dispelled the cloud-land in
which the Nile springs had so long been hidden:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The mystery of old Nile was solved; brave
men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had through the lion-haunted inland past,<br />
Dared all the perils of desert, gorge, and glen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Found the far Source at last.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With heroic patience they had accomplished on foot their
journey of thirteen hundred miles, and shown that the parent
stream of the Nile, even in its earliest course a considerable
river, was fed by the vast reservoir of the &ldquo;Victorian
Sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; What remained to be discovered was the feeders
of this vast basin, and which among them was indeed the primary
source of the Nile.&nbsp; Some fresher light was thrown on the
subject by Sir Samuel Baker, <a name="citation369"></a><a
href="#footnote369" class="citation">[369]</a> who, with his
wife, underwent some remarkable experiences in Central Africa,
and earned a right to be included among our Heroes of
Travel.&nbsp; Let us now follow him &ldquo;through scorching <a
name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 370</span>deserts and
thirsty sands; through swamp and jungle and interminable morass;
through difficulties, fatigues, and sickness,&rdquo; until we
stand with him on that high cliff where the great prize burst
upon his view, and he saw before him one of the chief sources of
the Nile in the Luta N&rsquo;zige, or Albert Lake.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Accompanied by his courageous and devoted wife, who insisted
upon sharing his labours and his perils, he sailed up the Nile
from Cairo on the 15th of April, 1861.&nbsp; In twenty-six days
they arrived at Kousko, whence they crossed the Nubian desert, so
as to cut off the western bend of the river, touching it again at
Abo&ugrave; Hamed.&nbsp; Eight days more and they reached Berber,
where they remained until the 11th of June.&nbsp; A year was
spent in exploring the Abyssinian frontier and the Abyssinian
tributaries of the Nile; and the travellers made their appearance
at Khart&ucirc;m on the 11th of June, 1862.&nbsp; Khart&ucirc;m
is a densely populated, unclean, and pestiferous town, in lat.
15&deg; 29&prime;, at the junction point of the White and Blue
Nile; it is the capital of the Soudan, and the seat of a
governor-general.&nbsp; Twenty years ago it was also the centre
of a cruel and desolating slave-trade, but the exertions of Sir
Samuel Baker and Colonel Gordon have done much to lessen its
proportions.</p>
<p>Having engaged a Nile boat, or dahabeeyah, and two larger
noggens or sailing barges, with an escort of forty armed men, and
forty sailors, and accumulated four months&rsquo; supplies of
provisions, Sir Samuel set sail from Khart&ucirc;m on the 18th of
December, 1862.&nbsp; On Christmas Day he was slowly ascending
the river, the banks of which were fringed with immense
forests.&nbsp; <a name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
371</span>These trees are the soont (<i>Acacia Arabica</i>),
which produce an excellent tannin; the fruit is used for that
purpose, and yields a rich brown dye.&nbsp; The straight smooth
trunks are thirty-five feet high, and about eighteen inches in
diameter.&nbsp; When in full foliage they look well from a
distance, but on a closer approach the forest is seen to be a
desolate swamp, completely overflowed; &ldquo;a mass of fallen
dead trees protruding from the stagnant waters, a solitary crane
perched here and there upon the rotten boughs; floating
water-plants massed together, and forming green swimming islands,
hitched generally among the sunken trunks and branches; sometimes
slowly descending with the sluggish stream, bearing,
spectre-like, storks thus voyaging on nature&rsquo;s rafts to
freer lands unknown.&rdquo;&nbsp; This kind of
scenery&mdash;depressing enough, no doubt&mdash;continues for a
considerable distance, and so long as it lasts deprives the Nile
of that romance with which it has been invested by the
imagination of poets.&nbsp; There is neither beauty nor interest
in it; and one is surprised to see the low flat banks studded
with populous villages.&nbsp; The flooded plains, however, afford
abundant pasture for the herds of the Shillooks, who in their
choice of a locality are governed by considerations of utility,
and not by the principles of &aelig;stheticism.</p>
<p>The junction of the Sobat takes place in lat. 9&deg;
21&prime;.&nbsp; This tributary, at the point of confluence, is a
hundred and twenty yards broad, and flows at the rate of two
miles and a half per hour.&nbsp; Still the Nile valley presents
the same characteristics&mdash;broad tracts of marsh and grasses;
dull, monotonous levels, unrelieved by any vividness of
colour.&nbsp; After receiving <a name="page372"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 372</span>the Bahr-el-Ghazal, the White Nile
turns abruptly to the south-east, and winds upward through a flat
country, which, in the rainy season, is resolved into a system of
extensive lakes.&nbsp; Its highway is half choked with floating
vegetation, which nurtures innumerable clouds of
mosquitoes.&nbsp; The people on its banks belong to the Nuehr
tribe; the women pierce the upper lip, and wear an ornament about
four inches long, of beads upon a iron wire, which projects like
the horn of a rhinoceros.&nbsp; The men are both tall and robust,
and armed with lances.&nbsp; They carry pipes that will hold
nearly a quarter of a pound of tobacco; when the supply of
&ldquo;the weed&rdquo; fails, they substitute charcoal.</p>
<p>The monotony of the voyage was broken one day by the
appearance of a hippopotamus close to Sir Samuel&rsquo;s
boat.&nbsp; He was about half grown, and in an instant a score of
men jumped into the water to seize him.&nbsp; The captain caught
him by the hind-leg; and then the crowd rushed in, and, with
ropes thrown from the vessel, slipped nooses over his head.&nbsp;
A grand struggle ensued, but as it seemed likely to result in a
victory for the hippopotamus, Sir Samuel slew him with a rifle
ball.&nbsp; The Arab seamen, who have an extraordinary appetite,
like the old school-men, for the most trivial arguments,
observing that the animal had been &ldquo;bullied&rdquo; and
scarred by some other and stronger hippopotamus, plunged into a
fierce contention on the point whether he had been misused by his
father or his mother.&nbsp; As they could not agree, they
referred the question to the arbitration of Sir Samuel, who
pacified both parties by the felicitous suggestion that perhaps
it was his uncle!&nbsp; <a name="page373"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 373</span>They set to work at once with
willing vigour to cut up the ill-treated hippopotamus, which
proved to be as fat as butter, and made most excellent soup.</p>
<p>Continuing their &ldquo;up-river&rdquo; course, the voyagers
came to the country of the Kegtah tribe.&nbsp; Such savages as
they saw were equally uncivilized and emaciated.&nbsp; The young
women wore no clothing, except a small piece of dressed hide
across the shoulders; the men, instead of the hide, assumed a
leopard-skin.&nbsp; There was greater appearance of intelligence
in the termites, or white ant, than in these poor half-starved
wretches.&nbsp; The white-ant hills here rise like castle-towers
above the water of the marshes.&nbsp; Their inmates build them
ten feet high in the dry season, and when the rains come, live
high and dry in the upper stories.&nbsp; Humanity, meanwhile,
sickens in the stagnant swamp, and lingers out a miserable
existence.&nbsp; The Bohr and Aliab tribes are a degree higher in
the scale of civilization, but the Shir go beyond them.&nbsp;
They are armed with well-made ebony clubs, two lances, a bow and
arrows; they carry upon their backs a neatly made miniature
stool, along with an immense pipe.&nbsp; The females are not
absolutely naked; they wear small lappets of tanned leather as
broad as the hand; at the back of the belt which supports this
apron is a tail, depending to the lower portions of the
thighs&mdash;a tail of finely cut strips of leather, which has
probably given rise to the Arab report that a tribe in Central
Africa had tails like horses.&nbsp; The huts here, and all along
the Nile, are circular, with entrances so low that the inmates
creep in and out on hands and knees.&nbsp; The men decorate their
heads with tufts of cock&rsquo;s feathers; their favourite
attitude, <a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>when standing, is on one leg, while leaning on a spear,
the uplifted leg reposing on the inside of the other knee.</p>
<p>All the White Nile tribes are quick to collect their harvest
of the lotus, or water-lily, seed, which they grind into flour,
and make into a kind of porridge.&nbsp; The seed-pod of the white
lotus resembles an unblown artichoke, and contains a number of
light red grains about the size of the mustard-seed, but in shape
like those of the poppy, and like them in flavour.&nbsp; The ripe
pods are strung upon reeds about four feet long, formed into
large bundles, and carried from the river to the villages, to be
dried in the sun, and stored away until wanted.</p>
<p>The 1st of February was a &ldquo;white day&rdquo; in the
voyagers&rsquo; calendar, for on that day the scenery of the
river underwent a welcome improvement.&nbsp; The marshes gave
place to dry ground; the well-wooded banks rose four feet above
the water level; the thickly populated country bloomed like an
orchard.&nbsp; At Gondokoro the picture was fresh and pleasant,
with a distant view of high mountains, and neat villages nestling
under the shade of evergreen trees.&nbsp; Gondokoro is not a
town, but merely a station of the ivory traders, and for ten
months of the year is almost a solitude.&nbsp; Its climate is hot
and unhealthy.&nbsp; Sir Samuel Baker did not meet with a
friendly reception.&nbsp; The men who profited by the slave-trade
regarded him with suspicion; they believed he had come to watch
their doings, and report them to the world.&nbsp; Their
hostility, however, did not disturb his composure, and he amused
himself in riding about the neighbourhood, and studying the place
and its inhabitants.&nbsp; He admired the exquisite <a
name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 375</span>cleanliness
of the native dwellings, which almost rose to the standard of the
famous village of Brock.&nbsp; Each house was enclosed by a hedge
of the impenetrable euphorbia, and the area within was neatly
plastered with a cement of ashes, cow-dung, and sand.&nbsp; Upon
this well-kept surface stood one or more huts, surrounded by
granaries of neat wicker-work, thatched, resting upon raised
platforms.&nbsp; The huts are built with projecting roofs for the
sake of shade, and the entrance is not more than two feet
high.&nbsp; On the death of a member of the family, he is buried
in the yard, his resting-place being indicated by a pole crowned
by a bunch of cock&rsquo;s feathers, and ornamented with a few
ox-horns and skulls.&nbsp; Each man carries with him, wherever he
goes, his weapons, pipe, and stool, the whole (except the stool)
being held between his legs when he is standing.&nbsp; The
Gondokoro natives belong to the Bari tribe: the men are well
grown; the women are not prepossessing, with good features, and
no sign of negro blood, except the woolly hair.&nbsp; They tattoo
themselves on stomach, sides, and back, and anoint their persons
with a peculiar red clay, abounding in oxide of iron.&nbsp; Their
principal weapon is the bow and arrow; the arrow they steep in
the juice of euphorbia and other poisonous plants.</p>
<p>At the secret instigation of the slave-traders, Sir Samuel
Baker&rsquo;s escort broke out into open mutiny, declaring that
they had not meat enough, and demanding leave to carry off the
oxen of the natives.&nbsp; The ringleader, an Arab, was so
violent that Sir Samuel ordered him to receive twenty-five
lashes.&nbsp; The vakeel, Saati, advanced to seize him, when many
of the men rushed to his rescue; and Sir Samuel was <a
name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 376</span>compelled
to interfere.&nbsp; The Arab then rushed at his employer; but Sir
Samuel knocked him back into the middle of the crowd, caught him
by the throat, and called to the vakeel for a rope to bind him;
but in an instant all the mutineers sprang forward to his
assistance.&nbsp; How the affair would have ended seems doubtful;
but as the fray took place within ten yards of the boat, Lady
Baker, who was ill with fever in the cabin, witnessed the whole
of it, and seeing her husband surrounded, rushed out, forced her
way into the middle of the crowd, and called on some of the least
mutinous to assist.&nbsp; For a moment the crowd wavered, and Sir
Samuel seized the opportunity to shout to the drummer-boy to beat
the drum.&nbsp; Immediately, the drum beat, and in his loudest
tones Sir Samuel ordered the men to &ldquo;fall in.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The instinct of discipline prevailed: two-thirds of the men fell
in, and formed in line, while the others retreated with the
ringleader, declaring he was badly hurt.&nbsp; Then Sir Samuel
insisted upon their all forming in line, and upon the ringleader
being brought forward.&nbsp; At this critical moment, Lady Baker,
with true feminine tact, implored her husband to forgive the man
if he kissed his hand and begged for pardon.&nbsp; The men were
completely conquered by this generosity, and called on their
ringleader to apologize, and that all would be right.&nbsp; Thus
the affair ended; but Sir Samuel rightly foresaw in it the
promise of future troubles.&nbsp; According to the custom of the
White Nile, the men had five months&rsquo; wages in advance; he
had therefore no control over them; yet he and his wife were
about to penetrate into the midst of a probably hostile native
population, with an escort on whose faithfulness no reliance
could be placed.</p>
<p><a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 377</span>On
the 15th of February, Captains Speke and Grant arrived at
Gondokoro, from the Victoria Nyanza, and the meeting between them
and Sir Samuel was necessarily very cordial.&nbsp; The
information they communicated had a material effect upon his
plans.&nbsp; He found that they had been unable to complete the
actual exploration of the Nile&mdash;that a most important
portion remained to be determined.&nbsp; It appears that in lat.
2&deg; 17&prime; N. they had crossed the Nile, after tracking it
from the Victoria Lake; that the river then turned suddenly to
the west, and that they did not touch it again until they arrived
in lat. 3&deg; 32&prime; N., when it was then flowing from the
west-south-west.&nbsp; The natives, and Kamrasi, King of Unyoro,
had assured them that the Nile from the Victoria Nyanza, which
they had crossed in lat. 2&deg; 17&prime; N., flowed westward for
several days&rsquo; journey, and at length fell into a large lake
called the Luta N&rsquo;zige (&ldquo;Dead Locust&rdquo;); that
this lake came from the south, and that the Nile, on entering its
northern extremity, almost immediately made its exit, and as a
navigable river continued its course to the north through the
Koshi and Madi countries.&nbsp; Circumstances prevented Speke and
Grant from pushing their explorations as far as the Luta
N&rsquo;zige; and the question that remained to be answered was,
What was the exact position of this lake in the basin of the
Nile? what was its relation to the great river?</p>
<p>This question Sir Samuel Baker resolved upon settling.&nbsp;
Speke and Grant sailed from Gondokoro, homeward bound, on the
26th, and he immediately began to prepare for his journey to the
Luta N&rsquo;zige.&nbsp; His preparations were delayed, however,
by the <a name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
378</span>mutinous conduct of his escort, and the obstacles
thrown in his path by the nefarious ivory-traders and
slave-hunters; and it was the 26th of March before he was able to
effect a start.&nbsp; Then, with his escort reduced in number to
fifteen men, with two faithful servants, Richard and the boy
Saat, and a heavily loaded caravan of camels and donkeys, with
Lady Baker mounted on a good strong Abyssinian hunter,
T&eacute;tel (&ldquo;Hartebeest&rdquo;), and Sir Samuel himself
on his horse Filfil (&ldquo;Pepper&rdquo;), and the British flag
waving proudly above the <i>cort&eacute;ge</i>, they left
Gondokoro, and began their march into Central Africa.</p>
<p>The country was park-like, but dried up by the hot
weather.&nbsp; The soil was sandy, but firm, and numerous
evergreen trees enlivened the landscape, which was further
animated by clusters of villages, each surrounded by a fence of
euphorbia.&nbsp; It varied greatly in character as the travellers
advanced; sometimes presenting a magnificent forest, sometimes a
dense jungle, sometimes a labyrinth of ravines, through which the
caravan made its way with difficulty.&nbsp; The view of the
valley of Tollogo was exceedingly picturesque.&nbsp; An abrupt
granite wall rose on the east side to a height of about a
thousand feet; from this perpendicular cliff huge blocks had
fallen, strewing the bottom with a confused mass of fragments,
among which the natives had built their village.&nbsp; A slow
stream wound its way in the hollow, which was nowhere more than
half a mile wide, in the shade of numerous fig trees.&nbsp; At
Ellyria Sir Samuel narrowly escaped a hostile encounter with an
ivory-trader&rsquo;s party, but through the firmness and <a
name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 379</span>skilfulness
of himself and his wife, not only was it avoided, but friendly
relations were established with its leader.&nbsp; No supplies,
however, could be procured from the natives, whose character Sir
Samuel paints in the darkest colours.&nbsp; Of the village of
Wakkala he gives a pleasant description.&nbsp; The soil was very
rich, and the ground being protected from the burning sun by the
large trees, there was a wealth of luscious grass; while the good
pasturage, the extensive forest, and a plentiful supply of water
insured a not less plentiful supply of wild
animals&mdash;antelopes in numerous varieties, rhinoceros,
buffaloes, elephants, and giraffes.&nbsp; The next town was
Latom&eacute;, where the traveller&rsquo;s presence of mind and
courage were tested by another mutiny; but again he succeeded in
defeating the intentions of the insurgents, and reducing them to
obedience.</p>
<p>Along the foot of the Lafut mountains, which attain a general
elevation of six to seven thousand feet, the travellers pursued
their way.&nbsp; Desertions reduced their escort by five men, but
they abated not their high hopes or spirit of daring
enterprise.&nbsp; They duly arrived at Tarangdl&eacute;, famous
for its fine trees&mdash;the chief settlement of the Latookas, a
fine, frank, and warlike race, who resemble the Irish in their
readiness to join either in a feast or a fray.&nbsp; The town
contains three thousand houses, each of which, as well as the
town itself, is protected by an iron-wood palisade.&nbsp; The
cattle are kept in large kraals, and at various points high
platforms are erected, where sentinels keep watch and ward both
day and night.&nbsp; The cattle are the wealth of the country,
and so rich are the Latookas in them, that <a
name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 380</span>ten or
twelve thousand head are housed in every large town.&nbsp; The
natives are constantly on guard to prevent the depredations of
neighbouring tribes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The houses of the Latookas,&rdquo; says Sir Samuel,
&ldquo;are generally bell-shaped, while others are precisely like
huge candle-extinguishers, about twenty-five feet high.&nbsp; The
roofs are neatly thatched, at an angle of about 75&deg;, resting
upon a circular wall about four feet high; thus the roof forms a
cap descending to within two feet and a half of the ground.&nbsp;
The doorway is only two feet and two inches high, thus an
entrance must be effected upon all-fours.&nbsp; The interior is
remarkably clean, but dark, as the architects have no idea of
windows.&nbsp; It is a curious fact that the circular form of hut
is the only style of architecture adopted among all the tribes of
Central Africa, and also among the Arabs of Upper Egypt; and
that, although these differ more or less in the form of the roof,
no tribe has ever yet sufficiently advanced to construct a
window.&nbsp; The town of Tarangdl&eacute; is arranged with
several entrances, in the shape of low archways through the
palisades; these are closed at night by large branches of the
hooked thorn of the kittur bush (a species of mimosa).&nbsp; The
main street is broad, but all others are studiously arranged to
admit of only one cow, in single file, between high stockades;
thus, in the event of an attack, these narrow passages could be
easily defended, and it would be impossible to drive off their
vast herds of cattle unless by the main street.&nbsp; The large
cattle kraals are accordingly arranged in various quarters in
connection with the great road, and the entrance of each kraal is
a small archway in the <a name="page381"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 381</span>strong iron-wood fence, sufficiently
wide to admit one ox at a time.&nbsp; Suspended from the arch is
a bell, formed of the shell of the Oolape palm-nut, against which
every animal must strike either its horns or back, on
entrance.&nbsp; Every tinkle of the bell announces the passage of
an ox into the kraal, and they are thus counted every evening
when brought home from pasture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While at Latooka Sir Samuel was enabled to gratify his passion
for the chase, and his skill and prowess were rewarded by the
capture of an elephant.&nbsp; There is a great difference, or
rather, there are three great differences between the African and
the Asiatic elephant: the back of the former is concave, that of
the latter convex; the former has an enormous ear, the latter a
comparatively small one; the head of the former has a convex
front, while that of the latter exposes a flat surface a little
above the trunk.&nbsp; The African animal is much larger than the
Asiatic; and while the latter seeks the forest depths during the
day, and does not wander forth upon the plains till towards
evening, the former remains all day in the vast open prairies,
where the thick grass springs to a height of twelve feet.&nbsp;
The African elephant feeds chiefly on the foliage of trees; the
Asiatic is an extensive grass feeder.</p>
<p>The natives hunt the elephant for the sake of the flesh and
the tusks.&nbsp; Sometimes he is caught in pitfalls; at other
times, the grass of the prairies is fired, and the elephants
gradually driven back into a confined area, where they are
surrounded and speared to death.&nbsp; Or, should a number of
elephants be in the neighbourhood of a village, about a hundred
<a name="page382"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 382</span>men,
armed with heavy-bladed lances, post themselves in as many trees,
while a multitude of natives gradually drive the animals towards
this ambush, when such as pass near enough are speared between
the shoulders.&nbsp; The Bagara Arabs are famous elephant
hunters.&nbsp; Armed with bamboo lances, tipped with a sharp iron
head, two of them, mounted on good horses, sally forth to secure
a prize.&nbsp; On coming in sight of a herd, they single out the
finest tusker and separate him from the others.&nbsp; One man
then leads the charge, and the animal, hotly pursued, turns
against the horse, which the rider so manages as to draw the
elephant further and further after him, while carefully keeping a
safe distance ahead.&nbsp; The other man, meanwhile, is at the
elephant&rsquo;s heels, and suddenly dismounting, while at full
gallop, plunges his spear into its body about two feet below the
junction of the tail, driving it with all his strength into the
abdomen, and then withdrawing it.&nbsp; If successful in his
thrust, he remounts his horse and escapes, or takes to flight on
foot, pursued by the elephant, until the attention of the latter
is drawn to his first assailant, who in his turn rides up, and
inflicts a wound.&nbsp; Sometimes the first wound proves fatal;
sometimes the process is repeated twice or thrice before the
animal succumbs; and sometimes the elephant overtakes his enemy,
in which case the latter must expect no mercy.</p>
<p>On the 2nd of May, 1863, leaving five men in charge of his
camp and baggage, Sir Samuel started for Obbo, crossing the
Kanisti river, and travelling through a bold and romantic
highland country.&nbsp; He found the vegetation of Obbo rich and
various; the soil <a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
383</span>produced nine kinds of yams, and many capital kinds of
fruit.&nbsp; Tobacco flourishes, and ground nuts are
plentiful.&nbsp; As for the people, they attire themselves in the
skin of an antelope or goat, wearing it mantle-wise across their
shoulders; but when on the warpath, they paint their body with
red and yellow stripes.&nbsp; Sir Samuel was received with all
the honours by Katchiba, the chief of Obbo, and entertained with
a grand dance, in which more vigour was displayed than
elegance.&nbsp; About a hundred men formed a ring; each holding
in his hand a small cup-shaped drum, formed of hollowed wood,
over the perforated end of which was lightly stretched the skin
of an elephant&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; In the centre was placed the
chief dancer, wearing, suspended from his shoulders, an immense
drum, also covered with elephant&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; The dance
commenced with a wild but agreeable chorus, the time being kept
by the big drum, and the small <i>tympana</i> striking in at
certain periods, with so much precision as to give the effect of
a single instrument.&nbsp; The figures varied continually, and
the whole terminated with a &ldquo;grand galop&rdquo; in double
circles, at a tremendous pace, the inner ring revolving in a
contrary direction to the outer.</p>
<p>Sir Samuel returned to Latooka, and collecting his baggage and
escort, started again for Obbo on the 13th of June.&nbsp; Here he
and his wife remained for several months, waiting for a
favourable opportunity to resume their southward march.&nbsp;
Their quinine was exhausted, and consequently they suffered much
from fever.&nbsp; Sir Samuel, in lieu of horses, purchased and
trained for their contemplated journey three robust oxen, named
respectively, &ldquo;Beef,&rdquo; &ldquo;Steaks,&rdquo; and <a
name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
384</span>&ldquo;Suet.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also obtained a supply of
porters to carry his luggage, and arranged with Ibrahim, the
friendly trader, that he should accompany him to Unyoro with a
guard of one hundred men.&nbsp; It was the 5th of January, 1864,
before the expedition started.&nbsp; On the very first day,
however, one of the oxen bolted; and Sir Samuel was compelled to
purchase another of one of the Turks at the price of a
double-barrelled gun.&nbsp; Three days&rsquo; march through a
beautiful country brought them to the Asua river, in lat. 3&deg;
12&prime; N.&nbsp; Its bed was almost dry.&nbsp; On the 13th they
arrived at Shooa.&nbsp; This is characterized as a lovely
place.&nbsp; A noble mountain of granite ascended in a sheer
precipice for about eight hundred feet from its base; perfectly
abrupt on the eastern side, the other parts were of gradual
inclination, covered with fine forest trees, and picturesquely
studded with villages.&nbsp; The surrounding country, with its
trees and rivulets and greensward, might have been taken for an
English park, but for the granite rocks that rose at intervals
like the gray ruins of ancient castles.</p>
<p>Shooa is a land of milk and honey.&nbsp; The travellers found
fowls, butter, and goats abundant and ridiculously cheap; and as
beads were highly valued, they effected some good bargains.&nbsp;
The women flocked to see the white lady, bringing her gifts of
milk and flowers, and receiving beads and bracelets in
return.&nbsp; They were gentle in manner, and evidently anxious
to establish friendly relations.&nbsp; Sir Samuel was struck by
the superior cultivation of the country.&nbsp; Large quantities
of sesamum were grown and carefully harvested, the crop being
collected in oblong frames about twenty feet long and twelve feet
high.&nbsp; <a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
385</span>These were inclined at an angle of about 60&deg;; the
pods of the sesamum plants hanging on one facet, so that the
frames resembled enormous brushes.&nbsp; When fully dried, the
crop was removed to the granaries, of which there were two kinds:
the wicker-work plastered over with cow-dung, supported on four
posts, with a thatched roof; and a simpler contrivance, which may
be thus described:&mdash;A stout pole, twenty feet long, was
fixed upright in the earth, and, at about four foot from the
ground, a bundle of strong and long reeds was tied tightly round
it.&nbsp; Round these reeds, at intervals, were fastened hoop of
wicker-work, until the structure assumed the shape of an inverted
umbrella half expanded.&nbsp; When this is filled with grain,
fresh reeds are added, until the work has extended to within a
few feet of the top of the pole.&nbsp; The whole is then crowned
with a covering of reeds, securely strapped, and resembles
nothing in the world so much as one of those cigars which
slightly bulge in the middle.</p>
<p>At Shooa all Sir Samuel&rsquo;s Obbo porters absconded, being
afraid to enter Kamrasi&rsquo;s country, and he found so much
difficulty in supplying their places, that he resolved on leaving
behind him every article that was not absolutely
indispensable.&nbsp; How different an appearance his expedition
presented to that which it had worn on leaving
Khart&ucirc;m!&nbsp; It was shorn of all its &ldquo;pride and
circumstance;&rdquo; but its leader remained as resolute and as
hopeful as ever, and started from Shooa on the 18th of January,
determined to press forward to the Luta N&rsquo;zige.&nbsp; After
passing Fatiko, a village perched like an eagle&rsquo;s eyrie on
a rocky table-land, he entered upon a sea of <a
name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span>prairies,
an immense undulating expanse of verdure, dotted with a few
palms.&nbsp; As his guide lost the road, Sir Samuel proposed to
clear the country to the south by firing the prairies, and a
strangely picturesque spectacle was the result.&nbsp; In a few
minutes the flames roared before them, and waves upon waves of
fire, and clouds upon clouds of smoke, rolled away to the far
horizon.&nbsp; Flocks of buzzards and swarms of beautiful
fly-catchers thronged to the spot, to prey upon the innumerable
insects that endeavoured to escape from the approaching
conflagration, which continued to extend until arrested by a
reedy swamp.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, the expedition reached the Victoria White Nile,
or, as it is sometimes called, the Somerset river, and proceeded
through the magnificent forest that crowned its bank to the
Karuma Falls.&nbsp; The river here was about a hundred and fifty
yards wide, and flowed between lofty cliffs, which were green
with vines, bananas, and palms.&nbsp; The falls, however, are
very insignificant, not exceeding five feet in height.&nbsp; Just
above them is a ferry, and Sir Samuel and Lady Baker crossing by
it, found themselves in Unyoro, King Kamrasi&rsquo;s country, and
in his town or village of Atado.&nbsp; Speke and Grant had left
behind them pleasant memories, so that Baker, as their friend and
countryman, received a hearty welcome.&nbsp; A large hut was
placed at the disposal of his wife and himself, and in exchange
for fresh beef&mdash;Sir Samuel ordering an ox to be killed for
the purpose&mdash;the natives furnished liberal quantities of
flour, beans, and sweet potatoes.&nbsp; A brisk market was
quickly set going, and whole rows of girls and women arrived,
bringing baskets filled with the desired provisions.&nbsp; The <a
name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 387</span>women, we
are told, were neatly dressed in short double-skirted petticoats:
many had the bosom bare: others wore a piece of bark-cloth,
plaid-wise, across chest and shoulders.&nbsp; Bark-cloth, which
is exclusively used throughout Equatorial Africa, is the produce
of a kind of fig tree.&nbsp; The bark is stripped off in large
pieces, soaked in water, and beaten with a mallet.&nbsp; In
appearance it much resembles corduroy, in colour tanned leather;
the finer qualities are peculiarly soft to the touch, like woven
cotton.</p>
<p>The travellers were struck by the difference between the
Unyoro people and the tribes they had previously seen.&nbsp; On
the north side of the Nile the natives were either wholly naked,
or wore only a piece of skin across their shoulders.&nbsp; The
river seemed to mark the limit or <i>ne plus ultra</i> of
savagedom, for the inhabitants of Unyoro shrank like Europeans
from the indecency and shame of nakedness.&nbsp; Their higher
civilization was shown also by their manufactures: their smiths
were very skilful, and used iron hammers instead of stone; they
converted into fine wire the thick brass and copper wire which
they received from Zanzibar; and their pottery showed a certain
degree of taste in conception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives,&rdquo; writes Sir Samuel, &ldquo;are
particularly neat in all they do; they never bring anything to
sell unless carefully packed in the neatest parcels, generally
formed of the bark of the plantain, and sometimes of the inner
portions of reeds stripped into snow-white stalks, which are
bound round the parcels with the utmost care.&nbsp; Should the
plantain cider, &lsquo;marossa,&rsquo; be brought in a jar, the
mouth is neatly covered with a finger-like mat of these clean <a
name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 388</span>white
rushes split into shreds.&nbsp; Not even tobacco is brought for
sale unless most carefully packed.&nbsp; During a journey, a
pretty, bottle-shaped, long-necked gourd is carried, with a store
of plantain cider; the mouth of the bottle is stopped with a
bundle of the white rush shreds, through which a reed is inserted
that reaches to the bottom; thus the drink can be sucked up
during the march without the necessity of halting; nor is it
possible to spill it by the movement of walking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The natives,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;prepare the skins
of goats very beautifully, making them as soft as chamois
leather; these they cut into squares, and sew them together as
neatly as would be effected by a European tailor, converting them
into mantles, which are prized far more highly than bark-cloth,
on account of their durability.&nbsp; They manufacture their own
needles, not by boring the eye, but by sharpening the end into a
fine point, and turning it over, the extremity being hammered
into a small cut in the body of the needle to prevent it from
catching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arrival of Sir Samuel Baker being made known to Kamrasi,
he requested him to pay a visit to his capital, and sent a legion
of porters to carry his baggage.&nbsp; Lady Baker suffered much
from illness on the journey, which she performed in a litter; and
Sir Samuel was also attacked by a debilitating fever.&nbsp; His
first interview with &ldquo;the king&rdquo; took place on the
10th of February.&nbsp; He describes him as a fine-looking man,
whose extremely prominent eyes gave a peculiar expression to his
countenance; about six feet high; and dressed in a long robe of
bark-cloth, draped in graceful folds.&nbsp; The nails of his
hands and <a name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
389</span>feet were carefully tended, and his complexion was
about as dark a brown as that of an Abyssinian.&nbsp; He sat upon
a copper stool, with a leopard-skin carpet spread around him, and
was attended by about ten of his principal chiefs.&nbsp; Of his
character as a man Sir Samuel Baker speaks in the most
unflattering terms; he was grasping, mean, mendacious, and a
coward.&nbsp; After some delay, and by dint of repeated bribes,
Sir Samuel obtained from him a supply of natives to carry the
baggage to the lake, where canoes were to be provided for the
voyage to Magango, a village situated at the junction of the
Somerset river.&nbsp; He went to take leave of the royal savage,
and was astonished by the insolent demand that Lady Baker should
be left with him!&nbsp; Sir Samuel drew his revolver; Lady Baker
broke out into invectives in Arabic, which the woman, Bachuta,
translated as nearly as she could, and with indignant emphasis,
into the language of Unyoro; in short, &ldquo;a scene&rdquo;
ensued!&nbsp; Kamrasi was completely cowed, and faltered out,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry!&nbsp; I had no intention of
offending you by asking for your wife; I will give you a wife, if
you want one, and I thought you might have no objection to give
me yours; it is my custom to give my visitors pretty wives, and I
thought you might exchange.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t make it fuss about
it: if you don&rsquo;t like it, there&rsquo;s an end of it; I
will never mention it again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Samuel received the
apology very sternly, and insisted upon starting.&nbsp; Kamrasi
did not feel in a position to interpose any further delay, and
the march to the lake began.</p>
<p>On the road a very painful incident occurred.&nbsp; The
expedition had reached Uafour river, which ran <a
name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 390</span>through the
centre of a marsh, and, although deep, was so thickly covered
with matted and tangled water grass and other aquatic plants,
that a natural floating bridge, some two feet in thickness, was
available for crossing.&nbsp; The men passed it quickly, sinking
merely to the ankles, though beneath the tough vegetation was
deep water.&nbsp; It was equally impossible to ride or be carried
over this fickle surface; Sir Samuel therefore led the way, and
begged his wife to follow on foot as quickly as possible, keeping
exactly in his track.&nbsp; The river was about eighty yards
wide, and Sir Samuel had scarcely accomplished a fourth of the
distance, when, looking back, he was horrified to see her
standing in one spot, and sinking gradually through the weeds,
while her face was distorted and perfectly purple.&nbsp; She
fell, as if stricken dead.&nbsp; Her husband was immediately by
her side, and, with the help of some of his men, dragged her
through the yielding vegetation, across to the other side.&nbsp;
There she was tenderly laid beneath a tree, and her husband
bathed her head and face with water, thinking she had
fainted.&nbsp; But he soon perceived that she was suffering from
a sunstroke; and, removing her to a miserable hut close at hand,
he watched anxiously for some sign of returning
consciousness.&nbsp; We shall quote his own words in all their
pathetic simplicity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing to eat in this spot.&nbsp; My wife
had never stirred since she fell by the <i>coup de soleil</i>,
and merely respired about five times a minute.&nbsp; It was
impossible to remain; the people would have starved.&nbsp; She
was laid gently upon her litter, and we started forward on our
funeral course.&nbsp; I was ill and broken-hearted, and I
followed by her side through <a name="page391"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 391</span>the long day&rsquo;s march over wild
park lands and streams, with thick forest and deep marshy
bottoms; over undulating hills, and through valleys of tall
papyrus rushes, which, as we brushed through them on our
melancholy way, waved over the litter like the black plumes of a
hearse.&nbsp; We halted at a village, and again the night was
passed in watching.&nbsp; I was wet, and coated with mud from the
swampy marsh, and shivered with ague; but the cold within was
greater than all.&nbsp; No change had taken place; she had never
moved.&nbsp; I had plenty of fat, and I made four balls of about
half a pound, each of which would burn for three hours.&nbsp; A
piece of a broken water-jar formed a lamp, several pieces of rag
serving for wicks.&nbsp; So in solitude the still calm night
passed away as I sat by her side and watched.&nbsp; In the drawn
and distorted features that lay before me I could hardly trace
the same form that for years had been my comfort through all the
difficulties and dangers of my path.&nbsp; Was she to die?&nbsp;
Was so terrible a sacrifice to be the result of my selfish
exile?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again the night passed away.&nbsp; Once more the
march.&nbsp; Though weak and ill, and for two nights without a
moment&rsquo;s sleep, I felt no fatigue, but mechanically
followed by the side of the litter as though in a dream.&nbsp;
The same wild country diversified with marsh and forest.&nbsp;
Again we halted.&nbsp; The night came, and I sat by her side in a
miserable hut, with the feeble lamp flickering while she lay, as
in death.&nbsp; She had never moved a muscle since she
fell.&nbsp; My people slept.&nbsp; I was alone, and no sound
broke the stillness of the night.&nbsp; The ears ached at the
utter silence, till the sudden wild cry <a
name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 392</span>of a
hy&aelig;na made me shudder as the horrible thought rushed
through my brain, that, should she be buried in this lonely spot,
the hy&aelig;na would . . . disturb her rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning was not far distant; it was past four
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I had passed the night in replacing wet
cloths upon her head, and moistening her lips, as she lay
apparently lifeless on her litter.&nbsp; I could do nothing more;
in solitude and abject misery in that dark hour, in a country of
savage heathens, thousands of miles away from a Christian land, I
beseeched an aid above all human, trusting alone to Him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning broke; my lamp had just burnt out, and,
cramped with the night&rsquo;s watching, I rose from my seat, and
seeing that she lay in the same unaltered state, I went to the
door of the hut to breathe one gasp of the fresh morning
air.&nbsp; I was watching the first red streak that heralded the
rising sun, when I was startled by the words, &lsquo;Thank
God,&rsquo; faintly uttered behind me.&nbsp; Suddenly she had
awoke from her torpor, and with a heart overflowing I went to her
bedside.&nbsp; Her eyes were full of madness!&nbsp; She spoke,
but the brain was gone!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p>Happily, after suffering for some days from brain fever, Lady
Baker recovered consciousness, and thenceforward her progress,
though slow, was sure.&nbsp; After a brief rest, the march to the
lake was resumed by the undaunted travellers; for the devoted
wife <a name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
393</span>would not allow any consideration of her comfort or
safety to come between her husband and the accomplishment of the
work he had undertaken.&nbsp; At a village called Parkani, the
guides informed them that they were only a day&rsquo;s journey
from the lake.&nbsp; In the west rose a lofty range of mountains,
and Sir Samuel Baker had conjectured that the N&rsquo;zige lay on
the other side of it, but he was told that it actually formed its
western or further boundary.&nbsp; Only a day&rsquo;s
journey!&nbsp; That night Sir Samuel could hardly sleep; his
brain was fired with the thought that he was within so short a
distance of the Source of the Nile&mdash;that in a few hours he
might drink of the waters of its mysterious fountain.&nbsp; He
was up before sunrise on the 14th of March, and crossing a deep
cool valley between the hills, ascended the slope, gained the
summit, and there, before him, flashing in the light of morning
like a sea of quick-silver or a huge mirror of polished steel,
lay the long-sought lake!&nbsp; The height on which he stood was
about fifteen hundred feet above its level, so that he could
survey the entire expanse of those welcome waters which had
created fertility in the heart of the desert, and made the fame
and wealth and glory of Egypt.&nbsp; He resolved that thenceforth
they should bear a great name, and as the eastern reservoir of
the Nile had been named after the Queen of England, he determined
that the western should commemorate her lost and lamented
consort, Prince Albert.&nbsp; It is therefore now known as the
Albert Lake.</p>
<p>With some difficulty, but with a grateful heart, he and his
wife descended the steep to the shore of <a
name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 394</span>the silent,
shining lake, and took up their quarters in a fishing village
called Vacovia.&nbsp; It was a wretched place, and the soil was
strongly impregnated with salt; but discomforts were forgotten in
the joy of a great discovery.&nbsp; Sir Samuel proceeded to
collect all the information he could relative to its
position.&nbsp; The chief of the village told him that its
breadth was immense, but that large canoes had been known to
cross from the other side after four days and nights of hard
rowing.&nbsp; That other side, the west, was included in the
great kingdom of Malegga, governed by King Kajoro, who traded
with Kamrasi from a point opposite to Magango, where the lake
contracted to the width of one day&rsquo;s voyage.&nbsp; South of
Malegga was a country named Tori, and the lake extended into the
kingdom of Karagw&eacute;, with whose sovereign, Rumanika, Speke
and Grant had maintained a friendly intercourse.&nbsp;
Karagw&eacute; partly bounded the lake on the eastern side, and
next to it, towards the north, came Utumbi; then, in succession,
came Uganda, Unyoro, Chop&eacute;.</p>
<p>The Albert Nyanza formed a vast basin of water, lying far
below the general level of the country, and receiving all its
drainage.&nbsp; It was surrounded by precipitous cliffs, which
left but a narrow strip of sand between them and the swelling
waves, and bounded on the west and south-west by huge
mountain-ranges, from five to seven thousand feet in
altitude.&nbsp; Sir Samuel Baker, after a careful survey,
concluded that it was the one great reservoir which received
everything, from the passing shower to the roaring mountain
torrent that drained from Central Africa towards the north.&nbsp;
Speke&rsquo;s Victoria Nyanza was a reservoir <a
name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 395</span>situated at
a considerable elevation, receiving the waters from the west of
the Kitangul&eacute; river, its principal feeder; but as the
Albert Lake extended much farther north than the Victoria, it
took up the river from the latter, and monopolized the entire
head-waters of the Nile.&nbsp; In Sir Samuel&rsquo;s opinion the
Albert was the great reservoir, while the Nile was the eastern
source; the parent streams that created these lakes were from the
same origin, and the Kitangul&eacute; poured its waters into the
Victoria, to be eventually received by the Albert.&nbsp; The
discoveries of Mr. Stanley, however, impose on geographers the
necessity of considerably modifying Sir Samuel Baker&rsquo;s
hypothesis, without detracting from the importance of his
discovery.&nbsp; The Albert Lake really holds an inferior
position to the Victoria, which unquestionably receives the
parent waters of the Nile; but it is not the less one of its
great reservoirs.</p>
<p>Having obtained a canoe at Vacovia, Sir Samuel explored the
north-eastern coast of the Albert, and after a voyage of thirteen
days arrived at Magango, where the Nile, or Somerset river, after
a winding course from the Victoria Nyanza, flows calmly into its
basin, to quit it again a few miles further north, and make its
way towards Egypt and the Mediterranean.&nbsp; At Magango the
lake is about seventeen miles wide, but to the north it ends in a
long strip or neck which a growth of tall green rushes almost
conceals.&nbsp; After leaving the lake, the Nile smoothly
descends its green valley, and is navigable for boats until it
reaches Agunddo, where it dashes headlong over a precipice of
thirty or forty feet.</p>
<p>Having completed his survey of the Albert, as far <a
name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 396</span>as his
means admitted, Sir Samuel determined, instead of retracing his
steps to Kamrasi&rsquo;s residence at &rsquo;Mroolli, to trace
the course of the Somerset or Nile river up to Karuma Falls, to
which point Speke and Grant had followed it downwards.&nbsp; The
canoes having been got ready, Baker and his wife began their
river voyage.&nbsp; About two miles from Magango the width
contracted from 500 to 250 yards.&nbsp; As they proceeded, the
river gradually narrowed to about 180 yards, and when the men
ceased paddling, they could distinctly hear the roar of
water.&nbsp; Arriving at a point where the river made a slight
turn, they saw the sandbanks covered with crocodiles; like logs
of timber, they lay together.&nbsp; The cliffs on either side
were steep and rugged, and the whole picture was rich in various
colouring.&nbsp; Foliage of the intensest green clothed each
rocky projection, and through a narrow cleft or gap in the
precipices the river plunged down before them in one vast leap of
about 120 feet.&nbsp; The fall of waters was white as snow, and
contrasted magnificently with the dark walls that held it in,
while the graceful palms of the tropics and wild plantains
increased the beauty of the view.&nbsp; This noble cataract, the
grandest on the Nile, Sir Samuel named the Murchison Falls, in
honour of the famous geologist and geographer.</p>
<p>It was impossible, of course, to pass the cataract, and the
voyagers made haste to land and collect their oxen and attendants
in order to resume their journey.&nbsp; The route they took was
parallel to the river, which continued to flow in a deep and
picturesque ravine.&nbsp; From an island called Palooan, a
succession of islets broke its course until near the <a
name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 397</span>Karuma
Falls.&nbsp; These islets belonged to two chiefs, Rionza and
Fowooka, who were bitter enemies of the King of Unyoro,
Kamrasi.&nbsp; On arriving at this point, Sir Samuel found that
they were at that very time engaged in hostilities, and that it
would be impossible for him to continue along the bank of the
river.&nbsp; Obstacles of every kind were thrown by the natives
in the onward path of the travellers, but in spite of ill health,
weakness, and weariness, they slowly pushed forward.&nbsp; Not
the least of their troubles was the scarcity of suitable
provisions, and they grew so feeble that at last even their brave
hearts gave way, and they began to despair of reaching
Gondokoro&mdash;to resign themselves to the thought of being
buried in that inhospitable land.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wrote
instructions in my journal,&rdquo; says Sir Samuel, &ldquo;in
case of death, and told my headman to be sure to deliver my maps,
observations, and papers to the English consul at Khart&ucirc;m;
this was my only care, as I feared that all my labour might be
lost should I die.&nbsp; I had no fear for my wife, as she was
quite as bad as I, and if one should die, the other would
certainly follow;&mdash;in fact, this had been agreed upon lest
she should fall into the hands of Kamrasi at my death.&nbsp; We
had struggled to win, and I thanked God that we had won; if death
were to be the price, at all events we were at the goal, and we
both looked upon death rather as a pleasure, as affording rest;
there would be no more suffering; no fever, no long journey
before us, that in our weak state was an infliction; the only
wish was to lay down the burthen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this wretched position Sir Samuel delivered <a
name="page398"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 398</span>himself, by
undertaking to assist Kamrasi in his war against Fowooka.&nbsp;
Whether this was a legitimate proceeding on the part of a
scientific explorer, who had no interest in the quarrel of either
party, may well be doubted, but the alliance led to his obtaining
an immediate supply of provisions.&nbsp; Natives were sent to
assist him and his wife in their journey to Kamrasi&rsquo;s camp
at Kisoona.&nbsp; But what was their surprise to find that the
Kamrasi whom they had interviewed at &rsquo;Mrooli was not, after
all, the real Kamrasi, the King of Unyoro, but his brother,
M&rsquo;Gami, whom Kamrasi had ordered to personate him, in an
access of alarm as to the traveller&rsquo;s possible
designs.&nbsp; Sir Samuel was indignant at the deception, and it
was with some difficulty that M&rsquo;Gami could prevail upon him
to forgive it.&nbsp; At last he consented to visit the king, and
something like an amicable understanding was established between
them.&nbsp; He was well supplied with provisions of all kinds,
and both his wife and himself slowly recovered their health and
spirits.&nbsp; By a dexterous use of the British flag he repelled
an attempted invasion of Fowooka&rsquo;s warriors; and he
rendered various services to Kamrasi, which met, we need hardly
say, with no adequate reward.&nbsp; It was the middle of November
before, in company with a caravan of ivory-traders under his old
friend Ibrahim, Sir Samuel was able to resume his return journey
to Gondokoro.&nbsp; The caravan consisted of about seven hundred
porters and eighty armed men, with women and children; in all,
about one thousand people.&nbsp; To provision such a body was
necessarily difficult, and there was no meat, although flour was
<a name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
399</span>abundant.&nbsp; Sir Samuel&rsquo;s skill as a hunter
was put into requisition to supply a little variety to the bill
of fare; and his bringing down a fine hartebeest was an event
which gave very general satisfaction.</p>
<p>Five days after leaving the Victoria Nile, the caravan arrived
at Shooa, where Sir Samuel and his wife received a hearty
welcome.&nbsp; Some months were spent in this pleasant locality,
the Turks profiting by the opportunity to make razzias upon the
neighbouring tribes, so that, for many miles around, the
blackened ruins of villages and the desolated fields bore witness
to their reckless cruelty; cattle were carried off in thousands,
and a fair and fertile region was converted into a dreary
wilderness.&nbsp; The captives made were detained to be sold as
slaves.&nbsp; On one occasion, among the victims brought in to
the Turkish camp was a pretty young girl of about fifteen.&nbsp;
She had been sold by auction, as usual, the day after the return
from the razzia, and had fallen to the lot of one of the
men.&nbsp; A few days later, there appeared in the camp a native
from the plundered village, intent upon ransoming the girl with a
quantity of ivory.&nbsp; He had scarcely entered the gateway,
when the girl, who was sitting at the door of her owner&rsquo;s
hut, descried him, and springing to her feet, ran with all the
speed her chained ankles permitted, and flung herself into his
arms, with the cry of &ldquo;My father!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes; it was
her father who, to rescue his child from degradation, had nobly
risked his life in his brutal enemy&rsquo;s camp.</p>
<p>The Turks who witnessed this particular incident, far from
being touched by any emotion of pity, rushed on to the
unfortunate native, tore him from <a name="page400"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 400</span>his daughter, and bound him tightly
with cords.&nbsp; At this time Sir Samuel was in his tent,
assisting some of his men to clean his rifles.&nbsp; Suddenly, at
a distance of less than a hundred paces, he heard three shots
fired.&nbsp; The men exclaimed, &ldquo;They have shot the abid
(native)!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What native?&rdquo; inquired Sir
Samuel; and his men replied by narrating the story we have just
recorded.&nbsp; Sir Samuel at first refused to believe it, but it
proved to be true in every detail, even in the last; for, bound
to a tree, lay the wretched father, shot dead with three
balls.</p>
<p>In the month of February the caravan started for
Gondokoro.&nbsp; The route lay at first through a fertile and
pleasant country, crossing twice the Un-y-Ami river, and touching
at its point of junction with the Nile, in lat. 3&deg; 32&prime;
N.&nbsp; On the north bank of the Un-y-Ami, about three miles
from its mouth, Sir Samuel saw the tamarind tree&mdash;the
&ldquo;Shadder-el-Sowar&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Traveller&rsquo;s
Tree&rdquo;), as the trading parties called it&mdash;which
indicated the limit of Signor Miani&rsquo;s explorations from
Gondokoro, and the furthest point reached by any traveller from
the north prior to Sir Samuel Baker&rsquo;s enterprise.&nbsp; The
journey was continued through a fine park-like extent of verdant
grass, covered with stately tamarind trees, which sheltered among
their branches great numbers of the brilliant yellow-breasted
pigeon.&nbsp; Ascending a rocky eminence by a laborious pass, Sir
Samuel, from the summit, which was eight hundred feet high, saw
before him the old historic river.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hurrah for the
old Nile!&rdquo; he said, and contemplated with eager gaze the
noble scene before him.&nbsp; Flowing from the westward, with
many a curve and bend, was the broad <a name="page401"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 401</span>sheet of unbroken water, four
hundred yards wide, exclusive of the thick belt of reeds on
either margin.&nbsp; Its source could be clearly traced for some
scores of miles, and the range of mountains on the west bank was
distantly visible that the travellers had previously sighted,
when on the route from Karuma to Shooa, at a distance of sixty
miles.&nbsp; This chain begins at Magango, and forms the Koshi
frontier of the Nile.&nbsp; The country opposite to Sir
Samuel&rsquo;s position was Koshi, which extends along the
<i>west</i> bank of the river to the Albert Lake.&nbsp; The
country which he was traversing extends, under the name of Madi,
along the <i>east</i> bank to the confluence of the Somerset
Nile, opposite Magango.</p>
<p>The Nile here enters a rocky valley between Gebel Kookoo and
the western mountains, and foams and frets around and against
rock and island, until, suddenly contracting, it breaks into a
roaring torrent, and dashes furiously onward in the shadow of
perpendicular cliffs.&nbsp; Waterfall succeeds to waterfall, and
it is difficult to identify the swollen, thunderous, angry river
with the calm clear stream that brightens the fertile pastures of
Shooa.&nbsp; In this part of its course it receives the
Asua.&nbsp; Through dense thickets of bamboos, and deep ravines
which, in the season of rains, pour their turbid tribute into the
great river, the caravan made its way; but in passing through a
gorge between two rocky hills it was attacked by a body of the
Bari natives, who were lying in ambush.&nbsp; Their bows and
arrows, however, proved ineffectual against the musketry of the
Turks, and they retired discomfited.&nbsp; This was the last
important incident of the journey to Gondokoro, where, after an
absence of <a name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
402</span>upwards of two years, Sir Samuel and Lady Baker arrived
in safety.</p>
<p>But what was their disappointment to find there neither
letters nor supplies!&nbsp; Their friends and agents had long
since given them up as dead; never believing that travellers
could penetrate into that far and savage south, and return
alive.&nbsp; There was no news from home; no money; no conveyance
provided to take them back to Khart&ucirc;m.&nbsp; With
characteristic energy Sir Samuel confronted his disappointment,
and instead of wringing his hands and waiting for the help that
would not come, he set actively to work, engaged a dahabeeyah for
the sum of four thousand piastres (&pound;40), removed his
baggage on board, collected provisions, took friendly leave of
Ibrahim and the traders, and, with the flag of Old England flying
at his masthead, set sail from Gondokoro.&nbsp; There is very
little to be said about the voyage to Khart&ucirc;m.&nbsp; Sir
Samuel shot some antelopes, and the progress of the dahabeeyah
beyond the junction of the Bahr-el-Ghazal was considerably
impeded by that natural dam of floating vegetation, intermingled
with reeds, sunburnt wood, and mud that here forms so signal an
obstruction to the navigation of the Upper Nile.&nbsp; To allow
of the passage of boats a canal has been cut, about ten feet
wide, but it requires constant clearance, and its transit is not
accomplished without considerable difficulty.&nbsp; Two
days&rsquo; hard work from morning till night carried the
voyagers through it, and with feelings of relief and exultation
they found themselves once more on the open Nile and beyond the
dam.&nbsp; But as they floated past the Sobat junction, the
terrible plague broke out on board their vessel, carrying off two
of <a name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 403</span>the
crew, and the boy Saat, who had served them so long and so
faithfully.&nbsp; It was a sad conclusion to an expedition which,
though fraught with sufferings, trials, and dangers, had, on the
whole, been crowned with complete success.</p>
<p>It was the evening of the 5th of May, 1865, when Sir Samuel
and Lady Baker entered Khart&ucirc;m, to be welcomed by the whole
European population as if they had risen from the dead.&nbsp; On
the 1st of July they left it for Berber.&nbsp; In making the
passage of the Cataracts they narrowly escaped shipwreck; their
boat, as it sped along under full sail before a high gale of
wind, struck broadside upon a sandbank.&nbsp; About sixty yards
below rose a ridge of rocks on which it seemed certain that the
vessel would be driven, if it cleared the bank; so that to avoid
Scylla was to rush into Charybdis.&nbsp; Sir Samuel, however,
proved equal to the occasion.&nbsp; An anchor was laid up stream;
the crew hauled on the cable, and the great force of the current
pressing against the vessels&rsquo; broadside, she wore gradually
round.&nbsp; All hands then laboured to clear away the sand,
which, when loosened by their hands and feet, the swift full
current rapidly carried away.&nbsp; For five hours they remained
in this position, with the boat cracking, and half filled with
water; however, a channel was opened at last, and slipping the
cable, Sir Samuel hoisted sail, and with the velocity of an
arrow, the head of the vessel swung round, and away she went,
plunging through the swirling, boiling water, and clearing the
rocks by a few inches.</p>
<p>They arrived at Berber, and procuring camels, started east for
Souakim on the Red Sea, a distance <a name="page404"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 404</span>of two hundred and seventy-five
miles.&nbsp; There they obtained passage on board an Egyptian
Government steamer, and in five days landed at Suez.&nbsp; Here
ends the record of their heroic enterprise. <a

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
